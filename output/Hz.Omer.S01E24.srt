1
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,800
Yes, indeed.
It was one of the Days of God.

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Nothing can now stop us, God willing,

3
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,200
and we will enter Damascus,
Hums, Qinnisrin and Jerusalem.

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,560
Well done, Abu Sulaiman.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Abu Bakr was right, may God have mercy...

6
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,240
May God have mercy on him and us,
when he said:

7
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,110
'Women could never beget the like of Khalid.'

8
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,500
We did not achieve victory
by the sword alone, Abu Ubaidah.

9
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,700
God will not cause to fail a community
that has someone

10
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,810
like Abu Ubaidah,
the trustee of the Muslim nation.

11
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,260
The clan of Makhzoom never knew
two brothers like you.

12
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,120
God has willed that death
will not seperate you.

13
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,390
To Him belongs whatever He takes.

14
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,100
Peace be to you until
God gathers us all to Him.

15
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,800
Congratulations to you
and to us all for this great victory.

16
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,000
May God reward you generously
for what you have done.

17
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,800
You are the best of Muslim women.

18
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,610
As for you, Umm Hakeem,

19
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,660
I pray to God to comfort you
after losing my cousin Ikrimah.

20
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,360
Submit him as an offering to God.

21
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,320
Muslims will cross the Yarmuk
until the end of time and say:

22
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,400
Here are buried Ikrimah,
as well as Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabeeah

23
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,100
and Salamah Ibn Hisham
and other companions of the Prophet.

24
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,310
Here was the beginning of Islam in Syria
and these were its keys.

25
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,290
Peace be to them all.

26
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,600
You will be all right, father.

27
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,290
Peace be to the people in the tent.
May I come in?

28
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,710
Come in, Abu Sulaiman.

29
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,910
You will be all right, Abu Sufyan.

30
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,710
You have made your apology to God.
Make your eye an offering to Him.

31
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,570
It is His. I would not mind if I lose both eyes.

32
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,540
now that God has honoured us with this victory.

33
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,050
As for avenging my eye, it will be
by taking Damascus soon, Abu Sulaiman.

34
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,950
Now that the Byzantines are demoralized,
you must not let them rest.

35
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,300
We will not, God willing.

36
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,700
How do you rate what my son,
Yazeed, has done?

37
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,100
He has fought well
and honoured his pledge to God.

38
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,160
It is right that you consider him the apple of your eye.

39
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,050
Which eye, Abu Sulaiman?

40
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,450
You will be all right. You will.

41
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,150
Lie down, son, until you recover.

42
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,450
I am all right.

43
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,030
I praise God who has seen me fighting
for God's cause.

44
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,330
next to my father, Suhail Ibn Amr.

45
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,700
I would have loved to have joined
my brother, Abdullah, as a martyr.

46
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,100
But God has willed otherwise.

47
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,060
How much Islam has changed us!

48
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,290
I can see myself in those old days
when I used to say to people:

49
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,690
Do not alter the religion of your forefathers.

50
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,770
Follow their way and stick to their practices.

51
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,370
Now I praise God for guiding me
to follow my two sons into Islam.

52
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,070
I am not ashamed
that they took the lead over me.

53
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,230
My Lord, bestow Your grace
on my son, Abdullah

54
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,640
May God have mercy on you, Abu Ubaidah.

55
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,540
Why have you kept the news from me
so that I hear it from others?

56
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,740
May God bestow His mercy on Abu Bakr.

57
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,920
To God we belong and to Him
we shall return.

58
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,800
He was certainly dearer to me than Umar,
but Umar is now the Caliph,

59
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,160
and God requires me to obey him.

60
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,960
There would not have been anything amiss
had I obeyed his order straightaway.

61
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,600
and become one of the soldiers,

62
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,330
to fight under the banner of our commander,
Abu Ubaidah.

63
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,990
I am not here to fight for Umar's sake,
but for the sake of Umar's Lord.

64
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,590
I wish you had told me right away and did not feel any embarrassment.

65
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:25,480
Yes, indeed. I felt very embarrassed.

66
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,190
I did not wish to spoil your delight
at your great victory,

67
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,490
when you are God's own drawn sword.

68
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:40,550
Abu Sulaiman, God knows that I seek
nothing of the glory of this world.

69
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,070
We are brothers, fulfilling God's orders.

70
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,370
You retain your position with me.

71
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,970
We shall not plan or fight
without your guidance.

72
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,650
Do not worry, Abu Ubaidah. How could I
disobey you when you have been a believer.

73
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,170
and follower of Islam long before me,

74
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,090
and when it was God's messenger who
called you the 'trustee of the Muslim nation'?

75
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,210
Now, I would like you
and all present to witness

76
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,590
that I am dedicating myself to God's cause,
and I will never oppose you.

77
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,560
Your majesty.

78
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,580
You are aware of what befell us at Yarmuk

79
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,440
Certain matters have occurred
at Constantinople

80
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,740
which require me to go back without delay.

81
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,790
I will monitor from there what happens
here in Syria from now on.

82
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,930
I will do my best to send you
all the reinforcements we can.

83
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,450
Repel the Muslims and keep them busy
at msuch as you can.

84
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,530
Our losses of army personnel
cannot be made good in a short while.

85
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,730
God decides what He will.

86
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,870
Farewell, Syria.

87
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,750
Farewell. I shall never see you again.

88
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,470
How much for one dirham?
Two small measures.

89
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,730
Two small ones for a dirham!
Why the high price?

90
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,150
I do not force anyone. Whoever finds
my price high can go to someone else.

91
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,950
If sonemoe else will sell for less,
you cannot sell your goods for this price.

92
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,490
Otherwise, you will be without customers.
I know what you are doing.

93
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,710
when farmers bring their grains to Madinah,
you beat the people to them,

94
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,210
buying all they bring so as
to make it a monopoly.

95
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,830
You withhold the goods from widows
and poor people.

96
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,970
By God, there will be no monopoly
in our market.

97
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,310
There will be no monopoly in our market.

98
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:00,460
Whoever brings goods to Madinah
to sell to all people...

99
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,320
will be Umar's guest

100
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,310
He can sell as he wants
and holds what he wants.

101
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,900
Sell four small measures for one dirham,
or else leave our market.

102
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,660
Otherwise, my punishment
will be administered.

103
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,070
Pardon me. I did not know
that it is unjust and forbidden.

104
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,650
And that too?

105
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,660
To all people in the market.

106
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,910
Anyone who wants to sell goods in our
market must acquire good knowledge

107
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,750
of what is permissible and what
is forbidden in trade transactions,

108
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,000
so that his work has no element of injustice

109
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,540
Otherwise he may well be guilty of usury
and illegal earnings,

110
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,540
whether willingly or unwillingly.
Do you hear me?

111
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,060
You should also know that I shall be
appointing officials in all markets,

112
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:59,630
to watch and monitor
and to arbitrate in disagreements.

113
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,030
No one should keep silent
when suffering injustice.

114
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,310
To suppress the truth
is to be like a dumb devil.

115
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,570
Happy news, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
Al-Yarmuk.

116
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,350
It is a great victory granted by God.

117
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,350
Here is a messenger from Abu Ubaidah.

118
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,730
All praise be to God; all praise be to God.

119
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,590
All praise be to God!

120
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,570
Now that God has granted victory
to the people of Yarmuk,

121
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,450
and has demoralized the Byzantines,

122
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,610
our friends are heading to Damascus.

123
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,510
You should help them by thanking God
for what He has given us all.

124
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,510
When you do, God will bestow
more grace on them and us.

125
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,250
All praise be to God.

126
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,530
Some of you may say:

127
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,340
why has Ameer Al-Mu'mineen relieved
Khalid of the command of the army in Syria,

128
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,850
when we know how much he has achieved?

129
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,850
You should know that I have not done so as
a result of any grudge or for any misdeed.

130
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,250
My decision is based on three reasons.

131
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,550
The first is that I often heard people saying:

132
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,640
no one can replace Khalid
or match his achievements,

133
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,090
or that without him this
or that would not have been achieved.

134
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,060
Hence, I feared that people should
give him a much higher status.

135
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,550
I want them to know that it is God
who determines everything.

136
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,650
What if Khalid dies,
will Islam be much weaker?

137
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,390
Will God's promise come to and end?

138
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,690
Before him, the best of mankind,
Muhammad, God's messenger, died

139
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,390
and the faith progressed according
to God's promise

140
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:06,290
A nation that attaches its affairs
to one man is bound to fail

141
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:12,350
When that man goes,
the whole system falls.

142
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,600
The second reason...

143
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:20,100
is that Khalid differs with me on the question
of the authority of governors & commanders.

144
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,250

He sticks to his view and will not budge.

145
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,030
He feels that a governor is independent,

146
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,620
and should conduct the affairs
of his area as he thinks fit,

147
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,250
without reference to the Caliph.

148
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:40,730
For my part, I believe that the Caliph
is accountable to God

149
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,060
for his own actions and those
of his governors and commanders.

150
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,360
The third reason is the governors
and commanders

151
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,360
do not only lead armies and plan battles.

152
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:59,230
We would have preferred
to avoid war altogether,

153
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,390
because our task is to provide guidance
for people and to advocate Islam.

154
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,780
Governors and commanders are also
responsible to manage people's affairs,

155
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,950
ensure justice, administer rights
and look after their subjects.

156
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,500
Syria is about to be part of the Islamic state,

157
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,640
when political management becomes
more important than war management.

158
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,540
Abu Ubaidah has the advantage
of a longer companionship with the Prophet.

159
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,390
Besides, he is a devout believer who reflects
on things, and he is kind to all people.

160
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,190
If Khalid is under him
and employs his military talent

161
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,530
in accordance with Abu Ubaidah's policy,

162
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,110
we are sure that the two
will perfect each other.

163
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,110
We can guarantee that the sword will not
dictate matters of management and policy.

164
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,110
This is a basic principle of government.

165
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,910
I have given this explanation so that
there will not be much talk about it

166
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,040
and to remove any suspicion
from people's minds.

167
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,040
This is what I have felt.

168
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:10,040
If I am right, it is only by God's grace,
and if I am wrong,

169
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,830
the fault is mine.

170
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,090
Prepare yourselves for a long siege.

171
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,710
I think we better divide our troops
to watch all five gates:

172
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,110
Khalid, myself...

173
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,850
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

174
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,250
Amr, Yazeed, and Shurahbeel:
each mans one gate.

175
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,330
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

176
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:06,830
We belong to the Arabs of Syria,
the Jafnah clan of Ghassan.

177
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,930
Good people and good kings.

178
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,170
Before Islam, our people were
always hosted well...

179
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,010
among you when they came
with their trade caravans.

180
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,410
This is why we have come to you now.

181
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,410
Although we follow the same religion
as the Byzantines,

182
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,410
we share with you our ancestry
and language.

183
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:38,150
We hate them for their dictatorial rule.
They treat us with arrogance,

184
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,150
when we are people of noble descent
and the owners of the land.

185
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,600
We have noted your fair rule
in the areas of Syria under your authority.

186
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,410
Therefore, we would like to join you.

187
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,250
We can command large forces.

188
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,250
In addition, we have knowledge
of the machinery suited for siege,

189
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,810
like mangonels. We learnt these
from the Byzantines.

190
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,310
We can help you with manufacturing them,
if you wish.

191
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,910
If you accept our offer
and we honour our commitment,

192
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,910
what do we get in return?

193
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,000
We will honour our commitment,
and you will be under our care.

194
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,430
We will observe God's unjunctions and the
instructions given to us by God's messenger,

195
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,490
his first successor
and Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

196
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,190
You shall not be force to convert to Islam.
Your lives and property would be safe.

197
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,730
will leave you to run your land
as you please,

198
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,670
with full autonomy as long as you
administer justice in your land.

199
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,490
If you wish to refer anything to us
for judgement,

200
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,760
we will give such judgement according
to our law which applies to us.

201
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,450
We do not impose on you any tribute
or land tax more than you can pay.

202
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,770
The tribute we call jizyah is less than
the zakat which is a duty applicable to us

203
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,770
and an act of worship.

204
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,630
Were we to impose it on you in line
with what is a duty to Muslims,

205
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,990
it would be taken as an act of religious
imposition. This is forbidden in Islam.

206
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:27,490
God says: 'No compulsion is admissible
in matters of religion'.

207
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,110
We also pledge to you that we will
protect you from our common enemies.

208
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,210
If we cannot, we take nothing from you.

209
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,550
We accept these terms.

210
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,550
As for provisions and supplies,
we have enough to last us six months.

211
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,250
Soon winter will come and they
cannot tolerate the cold weather,

212
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,250
considering that they come from
a hot desert climate.

213
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,810
They do not have the machines
used in siege which we know.

214
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,430

This means that we are safe within the city.

215
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,780
Return the milk to him.

216
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,650
This milk has been adulterated with water.

217
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,380
Do you not know that such cheating
is forbidden and God punishes for it

218
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,700
Give her back his money.

219
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,220
If you wish, take the milk home
and give it to your family.

220
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,880
If you do not, I will pour it here

221
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,070
and give orders for you to be flogged
in front of the people in the market.

222
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:34,570
If you do it again, I will kick you out
of the market and punish you severely.

223
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,960
Why do you interfere in my work?
Who are you to give orders?

224
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,600
All glory to God. Cheating and arrogance

225
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,990
Pardon me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
but this woman...

226
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,240
Didn't I promise to appoint officials
to watch how business is conducted

227
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,690
and to settle disputes between people

228
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:01,220
This woman is As-Shifa Bint Abdullah. I have
appointed her as controller of your market.

229
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,520
Whatever she rules is my ruling.

230
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,850
Any punishment she orders is my order.

231
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:16,330
If any of you is unsure of what is permissible
and what is forbidden regarding anything

232
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,050
should ask her.

233
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:26,650
she is competent,
and she enjoys my full trust.

234
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,530
What have you ruled in this man's case?

235
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,930
That he gives his milk to his own family,
or we will spill it.

236
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,730
If he does it again, we flog him
and kick him out of the market.

237
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,450
Had I seen him first
I would have flogged him first,

238
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:51,190
but now we approve As-Shifa's ruling.
Obey her.

239
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,500
Now return to your work.

240
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,500
Return the milk to him.

241
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,900
What is this?
A blessing from God.

242
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,600
Rather, punishment by God.

243
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,850
I say to all of you:

244
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,210
guard yourselves against getting fat,

245
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,410
because that will make you slacken
for prayer, and it spoils your bodies,

246
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,890
and brings you illnesses.

247
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:43,590
Eat moderately, for that helps you to be well
and keeps you from extravagance.

248
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,590
You will be better able
to conduct you worship

249
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,400
Your highness, Princess Buran.
At last, Commander Rustom.

250
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,930
You haven't let me down.

251
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,780
When I wrote to you in Khurasan,

252
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:48,580
I was certain that you are the one to save our kingdom.

253
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,150
I would not have undertaken
this responsibility

254
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,950
except for the fat that the scheming
of Queen Azarmidukht

255
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,650
and her commander Siyawakhsh
threatened to do away with all that

256
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,930
our forefathers have built
over a thousand years.

257
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:07,410
Then these noblemen grouped together and
placed the fate of the kingdom in my hand.

258
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:14,410
They know that I do not want to be queen,
but I want to save Persia.

259
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,250
Therefore, it was necessary to get rid
of Azarmidukht and her commander,

260
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,150
and to put and end to this long struggle
for the Persian throne.

261
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,750
This has been accomplished.

262
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,600
We have got rid of Azarmidukht
and Siyawakhsh the murderer.

263
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,170
My father was the first victim.

264
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,170
Nothing pleased me more than killing him
in revenge of my father

265
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,250
and for what he perpetrated.

266
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,550
These noblemen have done well to join you.
I am one of them to serve you.

267
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,990
Just give me your orders.

268
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,330
This is not the milk of my she-camel.
It tastes different.

269
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,330
Indeed, Ameer Al-Mu'mineed.
Where did you get it, man?

270
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,830
Your she-camel, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,
was left dry by her calf.

271
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,130
I milked for you one
of the she-camels of the state.

272
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,590
How dare you give me a drink of fire?
Are you not one of the Muslim community?

273
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,190
You have the right to your share in
the state property like any one of them.

274
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,890
It is just a drink of milk.

275
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,680
Nothing of the state property
is permissible for me other

276
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,580
than what I get the people's approval of.

277
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,790
Then get them to approve what you need
for your living and your family.

278
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,190
We have suffered much since you
have taken charge of the state.

279
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,640
You have abandoned your business
to attend to the affairs of the people.

280
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,430
We do not find enough to eat, and no
allowance has been given to you so far.

281
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,230
How shall we live?

282
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,930
They could not have reached
this stage without our help.

283
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,930
Our great kings have gone,

284
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,180
and their throne became
the property of the winner.

285
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,790
Every prince tries to overthrow
the incumbent.

286
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:05,790
Little do they realize that they may lose
the throne itself ot the Arabs.

287
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,640
Yes, commander.

288
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,080
Unless we are reunited, we will soon
see them besieging Al-Mada'in.

289
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,470
Could a day come when the Arabs are
the rules of Persia and we are their slaves?

290
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,510
Isn't death better than that?
Yes, Your highness. Death is better.

291
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,790
Well, make up your minds
before it is too late.

292
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,440
We have heard that they have raised another
army which is on its way to Al-Heerah

293
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,230
to join their army already there.

294
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,890
You know, Your highness, that the surviving
descendant of Khosrau Parves

295
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,390
has disappeared, fearing for his life,
after Shirweih killed his father the Khosrau

296
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,790
and his father's male offspring.

297
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,000
Then we plunged into what you know
of the other princes' rivalries for the throne.

298
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,900
They resorted to treachery and internal war.

299
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,900
Khosrau's descendants have the rightful
claim to the throne of Persia.

300
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,220
However, the present time
and circumstances

301
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,450
do not allow us a chance to search
for them and appointing one of them.

302
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,450
You are the only one who can unite us now.

303
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,250
I think you should assume the throne
for a period of ten years,

304
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,670
so that we can get rid of that Arab threat
and regain stability.

305
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,830
Then the kingdom may go back
to the descendants of Khosrau.

306
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,830
Yes, this is right.

307
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,630
If this is the only way,

308
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,030
then Commander Rustom is my minister
and the Commander-in-Chief.

309
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,330
I authorize him to manage the affairs
of the state on war footing.

310
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,610
Al-Fairuzan will be his deputy,

311
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,510
to manage the affairs of the state
when Rustom leads his armies.

312
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,360
Your throne, your majesty.

313
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,360
I pledge to you that I will defend
it with all my power.

314
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,160
The destiny of Persia is now in your hand,
minister and commander!

315
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,900
I promised you that I would take nothing
from the treasury

316
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,540
while I have enough of my own.
Now my money is gone.

317
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,010
What am I allowed to have
from the treasury?

318
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,310
Ameer al-Mu'mineen knows this
better than us.

319
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,710
Say what you think. we either accept
or tell you what we think.

320
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,630
The mount I need to travel
for pilgrimage or Umrah,

321
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,680
and my two robes for summer
and two robes for winter,

322
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:04,680
the food for my family,
and my share as a Muslim individual.

323
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,680
This is fair.

324
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,400
Do you all agree to this?
Yes.

325
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,690
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, the one who
is most entitled to have good food,

326
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,490
comfortable mount, fine clothes is you.

327
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,490
By God I do not think you said this
in honesty to God.

328
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,190
You only said it to have some favour
with me. I used to think well of you.

329
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,790
Do you know, man,
what my standing with these people is?

330
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,750
It is like a group of people travelling
together. They gave their expenses

331
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,910
to one of them and told him
to look after them.

332
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,980
It is permissible for him to take
of it something extra for himself?

333
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,980
No.
This is my case with them.

334
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,500
Why is this man walking in such a way?

335
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,500
Since when has devotion meant
a faint walk and a miserable look?

336
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,500
You are killing our religion, may God kill you.

337
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,400
Walk upright and show the dignity of Islam.

338
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,960
How come that some people think
that devotion means looking dead,

339
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,450
in the midst of the living?

340
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,770
Why would they speak softly,
bend their heads when walking,

341
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:30,090
and drop their heads
and shoulders in prayer?

342
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,950
Do they not fear that they may be
suspected of hypocrisy?

343
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:40,950
Hypocrisy may be in a show of piety
just as it may be in arrogance?

344
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,010
Both aim to show others
that one is better than them,

345
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,450
either in religion
or in what relates to the present life.

346
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:52,090
We have learnt that the new Muslim army
has not arrived in Iraq yet.

347
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,510
Their resident commander
at Al-Heerah, I mean...

348
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,950
Al-Muthanna
Yes

349
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,050
He has only a few thousand soldiers.

350
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,750
We better attack them
before the new reinforcements arrive.

351
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,010
We will send two armies: one goes
to Al-Heerah, commanded by Jaban.

352
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,850
The other army joins the force
between the two rivers.

353
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,970
Its commander will be Nersi.

354
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,490
I thought you would go
at the head of the armies.

355
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,220
No.

356
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,520
My plan is to send several armies,
one following the other.

357
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,770
This is harder for the enemy.

358
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:38,410
I fear that the princes, or commanders,
might be plotting against Princess Buran.

359
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,410
We have seen what others did.

360
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,310
They represent a greater danger
to the state than the Muslims.

361
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,310
I will discharge both responsibilities.
Let no one entertain any doubt.

362
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,400
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

363
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,850
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

364
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,170
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

365
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,370
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

366
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

367
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

368
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,150
Your face tells me that your news
is not good. Say it.

369
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,990
It is the worst news.

370
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,100
Jaban's army has been defeated
at Al-Namariq,

371
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,630
then Nersi's army was defeated first
at Al-Saqqatiyyah in Kaskar,

372
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,130
then at Baruka.

373
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,530
The Muslims then smashed Jalinus's army
which set out to reinforce Nersi.

374
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,320
The Muslims defeated four of our armies
in less than a month.

375
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,560
They regained the entire countryside
before conquering the city of Kaskar.

376
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,040
What has happened to Persia
which had previously defeated all corners?

377
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,760
Where are our soldiers who used to
spread panic wherever they went?

378
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,440
No. The fault is not with the soldiers;

379
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,560
It is with the commanders who want to
lead the soldiers to great victories

380
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,440
while they remain in their palaces here
at Al-Mada'in.

381
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,320
You mean Rustom.
Yes, Rustom.

382
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Your majesty made him
Commander-in-chief and minister,

383
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,000
assigning to him the task of managing
the affairs of the state.

384
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,600
I advised him to raise the armies
and go out himself, but he refused.

385
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,360
Now we have the outcome,
one defeat after another.

386
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,640
The Muslims are now in control
of the whole of Iraq, north to south.

387
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,600
Show us how they work.

388
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:00,640
The traitors!

389
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,640
By God, if the Muslims are turned back,

390
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
I shall punish all Syrian Arabs
who have helped them.

391
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,200
I shall crucify them in every city.

392
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,840
They have seen their brethern outside
the city siding with the Muslims.

393
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,240
I have no doubt that some of them here
communicate to their Arab brothers

394
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,760
outside news of what take place here
in Damascus.

395
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,000
Haven't I ordered that spies
should move among them?

396
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,480
Whoever they determine to be favouring
their own people over us

397
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,520
should be made a lesson to all others.

398
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,680
I have placed you ahead
of all commanders and princes.

399
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
I went against other people's advice.

400
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,040
I was content to allow you to manage
matters on a war footing.

401
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,520
I do not wish to say that I am let down,
but... such successive defeats!

402
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,440
The war is still evenly balanced,
your majesty

403
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,480
I am the one who is let down by Nersi,
Jaban, Jalinus and the tax collectors.

404
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,440
But you are the commander-in-chief, and
whatever these do will be attributed to you,

405
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,800
in victory or defeat.

406
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,120
You know that some princes and
commanders are watching what you do.

407
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,440
They have started whispering.
I do not know how to respond to them.

408
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,560
It is al-Fairuzan. I know that he is
the one who tries to undermine me.

409
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,840
He is jealous of my standing with you,

410
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,680
and would prefer that I should dissapear,
even if this meant that Persia is gone as well.

411
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,520
Don't you see, your majesty?
It is because of this that I preferred

412
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,760
that I do not go myself at this stage
to fight the Muslims.

413
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,920
If I did, I would be playing into his
and his friends' hands.

414
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,280
They would be able to plot against me
when I am away.

415
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,880
If they did when we are at war,
then the whole future of Persia is gone.

416
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,960
If you want me to sack him now,
that will only precipitate what you fear.

417
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,400
You know that he has supporters.

418
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,760
If he is sacked, they will revolt
against me and you.

419
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,720
That will be the end of Persia.

420
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,960
What is needed is that you should achieve
a great victory over the Muslims.

421
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,600
Victory in the battlefield will be a victory
for us over those who have ambitions here.


422
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,560
The two go hand in hand.
There is no other way.
