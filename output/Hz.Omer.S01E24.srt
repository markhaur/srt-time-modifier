1
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,800
Yes, indeed.
It was one of the Days of God.

2
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
Nothing can now stop us, God willing,

3
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,200
and we will enter Damascus,
Hums, Qinnisrin and Jerusalem.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,560
Well done, Abu Sulaiman.

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,200
Abu Bakr was right, may God have mercy...

6
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,240
May God have mercy on him and us,
when he said:

7
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,110
'Women could never beget the like of Khalid.'

8
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,500
We did not achieve victory
by the sword alone, Abu Ubaidah.

9
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,700
God will not cause to fail a community
that has someone

10
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,810
like Abu Ubaidah,
the trustee of the Muslim nation.

11
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,260
The clan of Makhzoom never knew
two brothers like you.

12
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,120
God has willed that death
will not seperate you.

13
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,390
To Him belongs whatever He takes.

14
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:41,100
Peace be to you until
God gathers us all to Him.

15
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,800
Congratulations to you
and to us all for this great victory.

16
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,000
May God reward you generously
for what you have done.

17
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,800
You are the best of Muslim women.

18
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,610
As for you, Umm Hakeem,

19
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,660
I pray to God to comfort you
after losing my cousin Ikrimah.

20
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,360
Submit him as an offering to God.

21
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,320
Muslims will cross the Yarmuk
until the end of time and say:

22
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,400
Here are buried Ikrimah,
as well as Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabeeah

23
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,100
and Salamah Ibn Hisham
and other companions of the Prophet.

24
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,310
Here was the beginning of Islam in Syria
and these were its keys.

25
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,290
Peace be to them all.

26
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,600
You will be all right, father.

27
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,290
Peace be to the people in the tent.
May I come in?

28
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,710
Come in, Abu Sulaiman.

29
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,910
You will be all right, Abu Sufyan.

30
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,710
You have made your apology to God.
Make your eye an offering to Him.

31
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,570
It is His. I would not mind if I lose both eyes.

32
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,540
now that God has honoured us with this victory.

33
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,050
As for avenging my eye, it will be
by taking Damascus soon, Abu Sulaiman.

34
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,950
Now that the Byzantines are demoralized,
you must not let them rest.

35
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,300
We will not, God willing.

36
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,700
How do you rate what my son,
Yazeed, has done?

37
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,100
He has fought well
and honoured his pledge to God.

38
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,160
It is right that you consider him the apple of your eye.

39
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,050
Which eye, Abu Sulaiman?

40
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,450
You will be all right. You will.

41
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,150
Lie down, son, until you recover.

42
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,450
I am all right.

43
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,030
I praise God who has seen me fighting
for God's cause.

44
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,330
next to my father, Suhail Ibn Amr.

45
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,700
I would have loved to have joined
my brother, Abdullah, as a martyr.

46
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,100
But God has willed otherwise.

47
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,060
How much Islam has changed us!

48
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,290
I can see myself in those old days
when I used to say to people:

49
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,690
Do not alter the religion of your forefathers.

50
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,770
Follow their way and stick to their practices.

51
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:58,370
Now I praise God for guiding me
to follow my two sons into Islam.

52
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:04,070
I am not ashamed
that they took the lead over me.

53
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,230
My Lord, bestow Your grace
on my son, Abdullah

54
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,640
May God have mercy on you, Abu Ubaidah.

55
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,540
Why have you kept the news from me
so that I hear it from others?

56
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,740
May God bestow His mercy on Abu Bakr.

57
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,920
To God we belong and to Him
we shall return.

58
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,800
He was certainly dearer to me than Umar,
but Umar is now the Caliph,

59
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,160
and God requires me to obey him.

60
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,960
There would not have been anything amiss
had I obeyed his order straightaway.

61
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,600
and become one of the soldiers,

62
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,330
to fight under the banner of our commander,
Abu Ubaidah.

63
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,990
I am not here to fight for Umar's sake,
but for the sake of Umar's Lord.

64
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,590
I wish you had told me right away and did not feel any embarrassment.

65
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:32,480
Yes, indeed. I felt very embarrassed.

66
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,190
I did not wish to spoil your delight
at your great victory,

67
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,490
when you are God's own drawn sword.

68
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,550
Abu Sulaiman, God knows that I seek
nothing of the glory of this world.

69
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,070
We are brothers, fulfilling God's orders.

70
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,370
You retain your position with me.

71
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:03,970
We shall not plan or fight
without your guidance.

72
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,650
Do not worry, Abu Ubaidah. How could I
disobey you when you have been a believer.

73
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,170
and follower of Islam long before me,

74
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,090
and when it was God's messenger who
called you the 'trustee of the Muslim nation'?

75
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,210
Now, I would like you
and all present to witness

76
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,590
that I am dedicating myself to God's cause,
and I will never oppose you.

77
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,560
Your majesty.

78
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,580
You are aware of what befell us at Yarmuk

79
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,440
Certain matters have occurred
at Constantinople

80
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,740
which require me to go back without delay.

81
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:16,790
I will monitor from there what happens
here in Syria from now on.

82
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,930
I will do my best to send you
all the reinforcements we can.

83
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,450
Repel the Muslims and keep them busy
at msuch as you can.

84
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,530
Our losses of army personnel
cannot be made good in a short while.

85
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,730
God decides what He will.

86
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,870
Farewell, Syria.

87
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,750
Farewell. I shall never see you again.

88
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,470
How much for one dirham?
Two small measures.

89
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,730
Two small ones for a dirham!
Why the high price?

90
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,150
I do not force anyone. Whoever finds
my price high can go to someone else.

91
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,950
If sonemoe else will sell for less,
you cannot sell your goods for this price.

92
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,490
Otherwise, you will be without customers.
I know what you are doing.

93
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:44,710
when farmers bring their grains to Madinah,
you beat the people to them,

94
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,210
buying all they bring so as
to make it a monopoly.

95
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,830
You withhold the goods from widows
and poor people.

96
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,970
By God, there will be no monopoly
in our market.

97
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,310
There will be no monopoly in our market.

98
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:07,460
Whoever brings goods to Madinah
to sell to all people...

99
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,320
will be Umar's guest

100
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,310
He can sell as he wants
and holds what he wants.

101
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,900
Sell four small measures for one dirham,
or else leave our market.

102
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,660
Otherwise, my punishment
will be administered.

103
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,070
Pardon me. I did not know
that it is unjust and forbidden.

104
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,650
And that too?

105
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,660
To all people in the market.

106
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,910
Anyone who wants to sell goods in our
market must acquire good knowledge

107
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,750
of what is permissible and what
is forbidden in trade transactions,

108
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,000
so that his work has no element of injustice

109
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,540
Otherwise he may well be guilty of usury
and illegal earnings,

110
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,540
whether willingly or unwillingly.
Do you hear me?

111
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,060
You should also know that I shall be
appointing officials in all markets,

112
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,630
to watch and monitor
and to arbitrate in disagreements.

113
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,030
No one should keep silent
when suffering injustice.

114
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,310
To suppress the truth
is to be like a dumb devil.

115
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:24,570
Happy news, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
Al-Yarmuk.

116
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,350
It is a great victory granted by God.

117
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,350
Here is a messenger from Abu Ubaidah.

118
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,730
All praise be to God; all praise be to God.

119
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,590
All praise be to God!

120
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,570
Now that God has granted victory
to the people of Yarmuk,

121
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,450
and has demoralized the Byzantines,

122
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,610
our friends are heading to Damascus.

123
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,510
You should help them by thanking God
for what He has given us all.

124
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,510
When you do, God will bestow
more grace on them and us.

125
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,250
All praise be to God.

126
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,530
Some of you may say:

127
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,340
why has Ameer Al-Mu'mineen relieved
Khalid of the command of the army in Syria,

128
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,850
when we know how much he has achieved?

129
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,850
You should know that I have not done so as
a result of any grudge or for any misdeed.

130
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,250
My decision is based on three reasons.

131
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:31,550
The first is that I often heard people saying:

132
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,640
no one can replace Khalid
or match his achievements,

133
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,090
or that without him this
or that would not have been achieved.

134
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,060
Hence, I feared that people should
give him a much higher status.

135
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,550
I want them to know that it is God
who determines everything.

136
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,650
What if Khalid dies,
will Islam be much weaker?

137
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,390
Will God's promise come to and end?

138
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,690
Before him, the best of mankind,
Muhammad, God's messenger, died

139
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,390
and the faith progressed according
to God's promise

140
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:13,290
A nation that attaches its affairs
to one man is bound to fail

141
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,350
When that man goes,
the whole system falls.

142
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,600
The second reason...

143
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:27,100
is that Khalid differs with me on the question
of the authority of governors & commanders.

144
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,250

He sticks to his view and will not budge.

145
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,030
He feels that a governor is independent,

146
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,620
and should conduct the affairs
of his area as he thinks fit,

147
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,250
without reference to the Caliph.

148
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:47,730
For my part, I believe that the Caliph
is accountable to God

149
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,060
for his own actions and those
of his governors and commanders.

150
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,360
The third reason is the governors
and commanders

151
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,360
do not only lead armies and plan battles.

152
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,230
We would have preferred
to avoid war altogether,

153
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,390
because our task is to provide guidance
for people and to advocate Islam.

154
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,780
Governors and commanders are also
responsible to manage people's affairs,

155
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,950
ensure justice, administer rights
and look after their subjects.

156
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,500
Syria is about to be part of the Islamic state,

157
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,640
when political management becomes
more important than war management.

158
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,540
Abu Ubaidah has the advantage
of a longer companionship with the Prophet.

159
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,390
Besides, he is a devout believer who reflects
on things, and he is kind to all people.

160
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,190
If Khalid is under him
and employs his military talent

161
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,530
in accordance with Abu Ubaidah's policy,

162
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,110
we are sure that the two
will perfect each other.

163
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,110
We can guarantee that the sword will not
dictate matters of management and policy.

164
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,110
This is a basic principle of government.

165
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,910
I have given this explanation so that
there will not be much talk about it

166
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,040
and to remove any suspicion
from people's minds.

167
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,040
This is what I have felt.

168
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:17,040
If I am right, it is only by God's grace,
and if I am wrong,

169
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,830
the fault is mine.

170
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,090
Prepare yourselves for a long siege.

171
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,710
I think we better divide our troops
to watch all five gates:

172
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:00,110
Khalid, myself...

173
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,850
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

174
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,250
Amr, Yazeed, and Shurahbeel:
each mans one gate.

175
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,330
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

176
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,830
We belong to the Arabs of Syria,
the Jafnah clan of Ghassan.

177
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,930
Good people and good kings.

178
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,170
Before Islam, our people were
always hosted well...

179
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,010
among you when they came
with their trade caravans.

180
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,410
This is why we have come to you now.

181
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,410
Although we follow the same religion
as the Byzantines,

182
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,410
we share with you our ancestry
and language.

183
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:45,150
We hate them for their dictatorial rule.
They treat us with arrogance,

184
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,150
when we are people of noble descent
and the owners of the land.

185
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,600
We have noted your fair rule
in the areas of Syria under your authority.

186
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,410
Therefore, we would like to join you.

187
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,250
We can command large forces.

188
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,250
In addition, we have knowledge
of the machinery suited for siege,

189
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,810
like mangonels. We learnt these
from the Byzantines.

190
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,310
We can help you with manufacturing them,
if you wish.

191
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,910
If you accept our offer
and we honour our commitment,

192
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,910
what do we get in return?

193
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,000
We will honour our commitment,
and you will be under our care.

194
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,430
We will observe God's unjunctions and the
instructions given to us by God's messenger,

195
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,490
his first successor
and Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

196
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,190
You shall not be force to convert to Islam.
Your lives and property would be safe.

197
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,730
will leave you to run your land
as you please,

198
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,670
with full autonomy as long as you
administer justice in your land.

199
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,490
If you wish to refer anything to us
for judgement,

200
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,760
we will give such judgement according
to our law which applies to us.

201
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,450
We do not impose on you any tribute
or land tax more than you can pay.

202
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,770
The tribute we call jizyah is less than
the zakat which is a duty applicable to us

203
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,770
and an act of worship.

204
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,630
Were we to impose it on you in line
with what is a duty to Muslims,

205
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,990
it would be taken as an act of religious
imposition. This is forbidden in Islam.

206
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,490
God says: 'No compulsion is admissible
in matters of religion'.

207
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,110
We also pledge to you that we will
protect you from our common enemies.

208
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,210
If we cannot, we take nothing from you.

209
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,550
We accept these terms.

210
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:55,550
As for provisions and supplies,
we have enough to last us six months.

211
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,250
Soon winter will come and they
cannot tolerate the cold weather,

212
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,250
considering that they come from
a hot desert climate.

213
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,810
They do not have the machines
used in siege which we know.

214
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,430

This means that we are safe within the city.

215
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,780
Return the milk to him.

216
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,650
This milk has been adulterated with water.

217
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,380
Do you not know that such cheating
is forbidden and God punishes for it

218
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,700
Give her back his money.

219
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:26,220
If you wish, take the milk home
and give it to your family.

220
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,880
If you do not, I will pour it here

221
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,070
and give orders for you to be flogged
in front of the people in the market.

222
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:41,570
If you do it again, I will kick you out
of the market and punish you severely.

223
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,960
Why do you interfere in my work?
Who are you to give orders?

224
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:51,600
All glory to God. Cheating and arrogance

225
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,990
Pardon me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
but this woman...

226
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,240
Didn't I promise to appoint officials
to watch how business is conducted

227
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,690
and to settle disputes between people

228
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:08,220
This woman is As-Shifa Bint Abdullah. I have
appointed her as controller of your market.

229
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,520
Whatever she rules is my ruling.

230
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,850
Any punishment she orders is my order.

231
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,330
If any of you is unsure of what is permissible
and what is forbidden regarding anything

232
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,050
should ask her.

233
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,650
she is competent,
and she enjoys my full trust.

234
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,530
What have you ruled in this man's case?

235
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,930
That he gives his milk to his own family,
or we will spill it.

236
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,730
If he does it again, we flog him
and kick him out of the market.

237
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,450
Had I seen him first
I would have flogged him first,

238
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:58,190
but now we approve As-Shifa's ruling.
Obey her.

239
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,500
Now return to your work.

240
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,500
Return the milk to him.

241
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,900
What is this?
A blessing from God.

242
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,600
Rather, punishment by God.

243
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,850
I say to all of you:

244
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,210
guard yourselves against getting fat,

245
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,410
because that will make you slacken
for prayer, and it spoils your bodies,

246
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,890
and brings you illnesses.

247
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:50,590
Eat moderately, for that helps you to be well
and keeps you from extravagance.

248
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,590
You will be better able
to conduct you worship

249
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,400
Your highness, Princess Buran.
At last, Commander Rustom.

250
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,930
You haven't let me down.

251
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,780
When I wrote to you in Khurasan,

252
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,580
I was certain that you are the one to save our kingdom.

253
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,150
I would not have undertaken
this responsibility

254
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,950
except for the fat that the scheming
of Queen Azarmidukht

255
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,650
and her commander Siyawakhsh
threatened to do away with all that

256
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,930
our forefathers have built
over a thousand years.

257
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:14,410
Then these noblemen grouped together and
placed the fate of the kingdom in my hand.

258
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:21,410
They know that I do not want to be queen,
but I want to save Persia.

259
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,250
Therefore, it was necessary to get rid
of Azarmidukht and her commander,

260
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,150
and to put and end to this long struggle
for the Persian throne.

261
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,750
This has been accomplished.

262
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,600
We have got rid of Azarmidukht
and Siyawakhsh the murderer.

263
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:39,170
My father was the first victim.

264
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,170
Nothing pleased me more than killing him
in revenge of my father

265
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,250
and for what he perpetrated.

266
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,550
These noblemen have done well to join you.
I am one of them to serve you.

267
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,990
Just give me your orders.

268
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:13,330
This is not the milk of my she-camel.
It tastes different.

269
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,330
Indeed, Ameer Al-Mu'mineed.
Where did you get it, man?

270
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,830
Your she-camel, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,
was left dry by her calf.

271
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,130
I milked for you one
of the she-camels of the state.

272
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:29,590
How dare you give me a drink of fire?
Are you not one of the Muslim community?

273
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,190
You have the right to your share in
the state property like any one of them.

274
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,890
It is just a drink of milk.

275
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,680
Nothing of the state property
is permissible for me other

276
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,580
than what I get the people's approval of.

277
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,790
Then get them to approve what you need
for your living and your family.

278
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,190
We have suffered much since you
have taken charge of the state.

279
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,640
You have abandoned your business
to attend to the affairs of the people.

280
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,430
We do not find enough to eat, and no
allowance has been given to you so far.

281
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,230
How shall we live?

282
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,930
They could not have reached
this stage without our help.

283
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,930
Our great kings have gone,

284
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,180
and their throne became
the property of the winner.

285
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,790
Every prince tries to overthrow
the incumbent.

286
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:12,790
Little do they realize that they may lose
the throne itself ot the Arabs.

287
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,640
Yes, commander.

288
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,080
Unless we are reunited, we will soon
see them besieging Al-Mada'in.

289
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,470
Could a day come when the Arabs are
the rules of Persia and we are their slaves?

290
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,510
Isn't death better than that?
Yes, Your highness. Death is better.

291
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,790
Well, make up your minds
before it is too late.

292
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,440
We have heard that they have raised another
army which is on its way to Al-Heerah

293
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,230
to join their army already there.

294
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,890
You know, Your highness, that the surviving
descendant of Khosrau Parves

295
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,390
has disappeared, fearing for his life,
after Shirweih killed his father the Khosrau

296
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,790
and his father's male offspring.

297
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:56,000
Then we plunged into what you know
of the other princes' rivalries for the throne.

298
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,900
They resorted to treachery and internal war.

299
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,900
Khosrau's descendants have the rightful
claim to the throne of Persia.

300
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,220
However, the present time
and circumstances

301
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,450
do not allow us a chance to search
for them and appointing one of them.

302
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,450
You are the only one who can unite us now.

303
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,250
I think you should assume the throne
for a period of ten years,

304
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,670
so that we can get rid of that Arab threat
and regain stability.

305
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,830
Then the kingdom may go back
to the descendants of Khosrau.

306
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,830
Yes, this is right.

307
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,630
If this is the only way,

308
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,030
then Commander Rustom is my minister
and the Commander-in-Chief.

309
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,330
I authorize him to manage the affairs
of the state on war footing.

310
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,610
Al-Fairuzan will be his deputy,

311
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,510
to manage the affairs of the state
when Rustom leads his armies.

312
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,360
Your throne, your majesty.

313
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,360
I pledge to you that I will defend
it with all my power.

314
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,160
The destiny of Persia is now in your hand,
minister and commander!

315
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,900
I promised you that I would take nothing
from the treasury

316
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,540
while I have enough of my own.
Now my money is gone.

317
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,010
What am I allowed to have
from the treasury?

318
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,310
Ameer al-Mu'mineen knows this
better than us.

319
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:53,710
Say what you think. we either accept
or tell you what we think.

320
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,630
The mount I need to travel
for pilgrimage or Umrah,

321
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,680
and my two robes for summer
and two robes for winter,

322
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:11,680
the food for my family,
and my share as a Muslim individual.

323
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,680
This is fair.

324
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,400
Do you all agree to this?
Yes.

325
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,690
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, the one who
is most entitled to have good food,

326
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,490
comfortable mount, fine clothes is you.

327
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,490
By God I do not think you said this
in honesty to God.

328
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,190
You only said it to have some favour
with me. I used to think well of you.

329
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,790
Do you know, man,
what my standing with these people is?

330
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,750
It is like a group of people travelling
together. They gave their expenses

331
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,910
to one of them and told him
to look after them.

332
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,980
It is permissible for him to take
of it something extra for himself?

333
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,980
No.
This is my case with them.

334
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,500
Why is this man walking in such a way?

335
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:09,500
Since when has devotion meant
a faint walk and a miserable look?

336
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,500
You are killing our religion, may God kill you.

337
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,400
Walk upright and show the dignity of Islam.

338
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,960
How come that some people think
that devotion means looking dead,

339
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,450
in the midst of the living?

340
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,770
Why would they speak softly,
bend their heads when walking,

341
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,090
and drop their heads
and shoulders in prayer?

342
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,950
Do they not fear that they may be
suspected of hypocrisy?

343
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,950
Hypocrisy may be in a show of piety
just as it may be in arrogance?

344
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,010
Both aim to show others
that one is better than them,

345
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,450
either in religion
or in what relates to the present life.

346
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,090
We have learnt that the new Muslim army
has not arrived in Iraq yet.

347
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,510
Their resident commander
at Al-Heerah, I mean...

348
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,950
Al-Muthanna
Yes

349
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,050
He has only a few thousand soldiers.

350
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,750
We better attack them
before the new reinforcements arrive.

351
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,010
We will send two armies: one goes
to Al-Heerah, commanded by Jaban.

352
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,850
The other army joins the force
between the two rivers.

353
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,970
Its commander will be Nersi.

354
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,490
I thought you would go
at the head of the armies.

355
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,220
No.

356
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,520
My plan is to send several armies,
one following the other.

357
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,770
This is harder for the enemy.

358
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,410
I fear that the princes, or commanders,
might be plotting against Princess Buran.

359
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,410
We have seen what others did.

360
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,310
They represent a greater danger
to the state than the Muslims.

361
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,310
I will discharge both responsibilities.
Let no one entertain any doubt.

362
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,400
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

363
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,850
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

364
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,170
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

365
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,370
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

366
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

367
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

368
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,150
Your face tells me that your news
is not good. Say it.

369
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,990
It is the worst news.

370
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,100
Jaban's army has been defeated
at Al-Namariq,

371
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,630
then Nersi's army was defeated first
at Al-Saqqatiyyah in Kaskar,

372
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,130
then at Baruka.

373
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,530
The Muslims then smashed Jalinus's army
which set out to reinforce Nersi.

374
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,320
The Muslims defeated four of our armies
in less than a month.

375
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,560
They regained the entire countryside
before conquering the city of Kaskar.

376
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,040
What has happened to Persia
which had previously defeated all corners?

377
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,760
Where are our soldiers who used to
spread panic wherever they went?

378
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,440
No. The fault is not with the soldiers;

379
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,560
It is with the commanders who want to
lead the soldiers to great victories

380
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,440
while they remain in their palaces here
at Al-Mada'in.

381
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,320
You mean Rustom.
Yes, Rustom.

382
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,600
Your majesty made him
Commander-in-chief and minister,

383
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,000
assigning to him the task of managing
the affairs of the state.

384
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,600
I advised him to raise the armies
and go out himself, but he refused.

385
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,360
Now we have the outcome,
one defeat after another.

386
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,640
The Muslims are now in control
of the whole of Iraq, north to south.

387
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
Show us how they work.

388
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:07,640
The traitors!

389
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,640
By God, if the Muslims are turned back,

390
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,000
I shall punish all Syrian Arabs
who have helped them.

391
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,200
I shall crucify them in every city.

392
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:26,840
They have seen their brethern outside
the city siding with the Muslims.

393
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,240
I have no doubt that some of them here
communicate to their Arab brothers

394
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,760
outside news of what take place here
in Damascus.

395
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,000
Haven't I ordered that spies
should move among them?

396
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,480
Whoever they determine to be favouring
their own people over us

397
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,520
should be made a lesson to all others.

398
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,680
I have placed you ahead
of all commanders and princes.

399
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,040
I went against other people's advice.

400
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:15,040
I was content to allow you to manage
matters on a war footing.

401
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,520
I do not wish to say that I am let down,
but... such successive defeats!

402
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,440
The war is still evenly balanced,
your majesty

403
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,480
I am the one who is let down by Nersi,
Jaban, Jalinus and the tax collectors.

404
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,440
But you are the commander-in-chief, and
whatever these do will be attributed to you,

405
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,800
in victory or defeat.

406
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,120
You know that some princes and
commanders are watching what you do.

407
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,440
They have started whispering.
I do not know how to respond to them.

408
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,560
It is al-Fairuzan. I know that he is
the one who tries to undermine me.

409
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,840
He is jealous of my standing with you,

410
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,680
and would prefer that I should dissapear,
even if this meant that Persia is gone as well.

411
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,520
Don't you see, your majesty?
It is because of this that I preferred

412
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,760
that I do not go myself at this stage
to fight the Muslims.

413
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,920
If I did, I would be playing into his
and his friends' hands.

414
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,280
They would be able to plot against me
when I am away.

415
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,880
If they did when we are at war,
then the whole future of Persia is gone.

416
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,960
If you want me to sack him now,
that will only precipitate what you fear.

417
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,400
You know that he has supporters.

418
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,760
If he is sacked, they will revolt
against me and you.

419
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,720
That will be the end of Persia.

420
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,960
What is needed is that you should achieve
a great victory over the Muslims.

421
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,600
Victory in the battlefield will be a victory
for us over those who have ambitions here.


422
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,560
The two go hand in hand.
There is no other way.
