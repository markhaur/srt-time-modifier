1
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes, indeed.
It was one of the Days of God.

2
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Nothing can now stop us, God willing,

3
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,200
and we will enter Damascus,
Hums, Qinnisrin and Jerusalem.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Well done, Abu Sulaiman.

5
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
Abu Bakr was right, may God have mercy...

6
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,240
May God have mercy on him and us,
when he said:

7
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,110
'Women could never beget the like of Khalid.'

8
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,500
We did not achieve victory
by the sword alone, Abu Ubaidah.

9
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,700
God will not cause to fail a community
that has someone

10
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,810
like Abu Ubaidah,
the trustee of the Muslim nation.

11
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,260
The clan of Makhzoom never knew
two brothers like you.

12
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,120
God has willed that death
will not seperate you.

13
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,390
To Him belongs whatever He takes.

14
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:38,100
Peace be to you until
God gathers us all to Him.

15
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,800
Congratulations to you
and to us all for this great victory.

16
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,000
May God reward you generously
for what you have done.

17
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,800
You are the best of Muslim women.

18
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,610
As for you, Umm Hakeem,

19
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,660
I pray to God to comfort you
after losing my cousin Ikrimah.

20
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,360
Submit him as an offering to God.

21
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:22,320
Muslims will cross the Yarmuk
until the end of time and say:

22
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,400
Here are buried Ikrimah,
as well as Ayyash Ibn Abi Rabeeah

23
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,100
and Salamah Ibn Hisham
and other companions of the Prophet.

24
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:37,310
Here was the beginning of Islam in Syria
and these were its keys.

25
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,290
Peace be to them all.

26
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,600
You will be all right, father.

27
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,290
Peace be to the people in the tent.
May I come in?

28
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,710
Come in, Abu Sulaiman.

29
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,910
You will be all right, Abu Sufyan.

30
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,710
You have made your apology to God.
Make your eye an offering to Him.

31
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,570
It is His. I would not mind if I lose both eyes.

32
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,540
now that God has honoured us with this victory.

33
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,050
As for avenging my eye, it will be
by taking Damascus soon, Abu Sulaiman.

34
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,950
Now that the Byzantines are demoralized,
you must not let them rest.

35
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,300
We will not, God willing.

36
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,700
How do you rate what my son,
Yazeed, has done?

37
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,100
He has fought well
and honoured his pledge to God.

38
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,160
It is right that you consider him the apple of your eye.

39
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,050
Which eye, Abu Sulaiman?

40
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,450
You will be all right. You will.

41
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,150
Lie down, son, until you recover.

42
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,450
I am all right.

43
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,030
I praise God who has seen me fighting
for God's cause.

44
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,330
next to my father, Suhail Ibn Amr.

45
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,700
I would have loved to have joined
my brother, Abdullah, as a martyr.

46
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,100
But God has willed otherwise.

47
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,060
How much Islam has changed us!

48
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,290
I can see myself in those old days
when I used to say to people:

49
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,690
Do not alter the religion of your forefathers.

50
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,770
Follow their way and stick to their practices.

51
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,370
Now I praise God for guiding me
to follow my two sons into Islam.

52
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,070
I am not ashamed
that they took the lead over me.

53
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,230
My Lord, bestow Your grace
on my son, Abdullah

54
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,640
May God have mercy on you, Abu Ubaidah.

55
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,540
Why have you kept the news from me
so that I hear it from others?

56
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,740
May God bestow His mercy on Abu Bakr.

57
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,920
To God we belong and to Him
we shall return.

58
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,800
He was certainly dearer to me than Umar,
but Umar is now the Caliph,

59
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,160
and God requires me to obey him.

60
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,960
There would not have been anything amiss
had I obeyed his order straightaway.

61
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,600
and become one of the soldiers,

62
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,330
to fight under the banner of our commander,
Abu Ubaidah.

63
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,990
I am not here to fight for Umar's sake,
but for the sake of Umar's Lord.

64
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,590
I wish you had told me right away and did not feel any embarrassment.

65
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,480
Yes, indeed. I felt very embarrassed.

66
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,190
I did not wish to spoil your delight
at your great victory,

67
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,490
when you are God's own drawn sword.

68
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:44,550
Abu Sulaiman, God knows that I seek
nothing of the glory of this world.

69
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,070
We are brothers, fulfilling God's orders.

70
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,370
You retain your position with me.

71
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,970
We shall not plan or fight
without your guidance.

72
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,650
Do not worry, Abu Ubaidah. How could I
disobey you when you have been a believer.

73
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,170
and follower of Islam long before me,

74
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,090
and when it was God's messenger who
called you the 'trustee of the Muslim nation'?

75
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,210
Now, I would like you
and all present to witness

76
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,590
that I am dedicating myself to God's cause,
and I will never oppose you.

77
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,560
Your majesty.

78
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,580
You are aware of what befell us at Yarmuk

79
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,440
Certain matters have occurred
at Constantinople

80
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,740
which require me to go back without delay.

81
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,790
I will monitor from there what happens
here in Syria from now on.

82
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,930
I will do my best to send you
all the reinforcements we can.

83
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,450
Repel the Muslims and keep them busy
at msuch as you can.

84
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,530
Our losses of army personnel
cannot be made good in a short while.

85
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,730
God decides what He will.

86
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,870
Farewell, Syria.

87
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,750
Farewell. I shall never see you again.

88
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,470
How much for one dirham?
Two small measures.

89
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,730
Two small ones for a dirham!
Why the high price?

90
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,150
I do not force anyone. Whoever finds
my price high can go to someone else.

91
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,950
If sonemoe else will sell for less,
you cannot sell your goods for this price.

92
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,490
Otherwise, you will be without customers.
I know what you are doing.

93
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,710
when farmers bring their grains to Madinah,
you beat the people to them,

94
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,210
buying all they bring so as
to make it a monopoly.

95
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,830
You withhold the goods from widows
and poor people.

96
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,970
By God, there will be no monopoly
in our market.

97
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,310
There will be no monopoly in our market.

98
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:04,460
Whoever brings goods to Madinah
to sell to all people...

99
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,320
will be Umar's guest

100
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,310
He can sell as he wants
and holds what he wants.

101
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:19,900
Sell four small measures for one dirham,
or else leave our market.

102
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,660
Otherwise, my punishment
will be administered.

103
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,070
Pardon me. I did not know
that it is unjust and forbidden.

104
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,650
And that too?

105
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,660
To all people in the market.

106
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,910
Anyone who wants to sell goods in our
market must acquire good knowledge

107
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,750
of what is permissible and what
is forbidden in trade transactions,

108
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,000
so that his work has no element of injustice

109
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,540
Otherwise he may well be guilty of usury
and illegal earnings,

110
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,540
whether willingly or unwillingly.
Do you hear me?

111
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,060
You should also know that I shall be
appointing officials in all markets,

112
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,630
to watch and monitor
and to arbitrate in disagreements.

113
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,030
No one should keep silent
when suffering injustice.

114
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,310
To suppress the truth
is to be like a dumb devil.

115
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,570
Happy news, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
Al-Yarmuk.

116
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,350
It is a great victory granted by God.

117
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,350
Here is a messenger from Abu Ubaidah.

118
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,730
All praise be to God; all praise be to God.

119
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,590
All praise be to God!

120
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,570
Now that God has granted victory
to the people of Yarmuk,

121
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,450
and has demoralized the Byzantines,

122
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,610
our friends are heading to Damascus.

123
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,510
You should help them by thanking God
for what He has given us all.

124
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,510
When you do, God will bestow
more grace on them and us.

125
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,250
All praise be to God.

126
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,530
Some of you may say:

127
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,340
why has Ameer Al-Mu'mineen relieved
Khalid of the command of the army in Syria,

128
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,850
when we know how much he has achieved?

129
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,850
You should know that I have not done so as
a result of any grudge or for any misdeed.

130
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,250
My decision is based on three reasons.

131
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,550
The first is that I often heard people saying:

132
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,640
no one can replace Khalid
or match his achievements,

133
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,090
or that without him this
or that would not have been achieved.

134
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,060
Hence, I feared that people should
give him a much higher status.

135
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,550
I want them to know that it is God
who determines everything.

136
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:50,650
What if Khalid dies,
will Islam be much weaker?

137
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,390
Will God's promise come to and end?

138
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:59,690
Before him, the best of mankind,
Muhammad, God's messenger, died

139
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,390
and the faith progressed according
to God's promise

140
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,290
A nation that attaches its affairs
to one man is bound to fail

141
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,350
When that man goes,
the whole system falls.

142
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,600
The second reason...

143
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,100
is that Khalid differs with me on the question
of the authority of governors & commanders.

144
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,250

He sticks to his view and will not budge.

145
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,030
He feels that a governor is independent,

146
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,620
and should conduct the affairs
of his area as he thinks fit,

147
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,250
without reference to the Caliph.

148
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,730
For my part, I believe that the Caliph
is accountable to God

149
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,060
for his own actions and those
of his governors and commanders.

150
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,360
The third reason is the governors
and commanders

151
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:59,360
do not only lead armies and plan battles.

152
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,230
We would have preferred
to avoid war altogether,

153
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,390
because our task is to provide guidance
for people and to advocate Islam.

154
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,780
Governors and commanders are also
responsible to manage people's affairs,

155
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,950
ensure justice, administer rights
and look after their subjects.

156
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,500
Syria is about to be part of the Islamic state,

157
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,640
when political management becomes
more important than war management.

158
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,540
Abu Ubaidah has the advantage
of a longer companionship with the Prophet.

159
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,390
Besides, he is a devout believer who reflects
on things, and he is kind to all people.

160
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,190
If Khalid is under him
and employs his military talent

161
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,530
in accordance with Abu Ubaidah's policy,

162
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,110
we are sure that the two
will perfect each other.

163
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,110
We can guarantee that the sword will not
dictate matters of management and policy.

164
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,110
This is a basic principle of government.

165
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,910
I have given this explanation so that
there will not be much talk about it

166
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,040
and to remove any suspicion
from people's minds.

167
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,040
This is what I have felt.

168
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:14,040
If I am right, it is only by God's grace,
and if I am wrong,

169
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,830
the fault is mine.

170
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,090
Prepare yourselves for a long siege.

171
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,710
I think we better divide our troops
to watch all five gates:

172
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,110
Khalid, myself...

173
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,850
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

174
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,250
Amr, Yazeed, and Shurahbeel:
each mans one gate.

175
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,330
Who is the commander?
Speak, may God give you guidance.

176
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,830
We belong to the Arabs of Syria,
the Jafnah clan of Ghassan.

177
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,930
Good people and good kings.

178
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,170
Before Islam, our people were
always hosted well...

179
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,010
among you when they came
with their trade caravans.

180
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,410
This is why we have come to you now.

181
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,410
Although we follow the same religion
as the Byzantines,

182
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,410
we share with you our ancestry
and language.

183
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:42,150
We hate them for their dictatorial rule.
They treat us with arrogance,

184
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,150
when we are people of noble descent
and the owners of the land.

185
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,600
We have noted your fair rule
in the areas of Syria under your authority.

186
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,410
Therefore, we would like to join you.

187
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,250
We can command large forces.

188
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:10,250
In addition, we have knowledge
of the machinery suited for siege,

189
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,810
like mangonels. We learnt these
from the Byzantines.

190
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,310
We can help you with manufacturing them,
if you wish.

191
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,910
If you accept our offer
and we honour our commitment,

192
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,910
what do we get in return?

193
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,000
We will honour our commitment,
and you will be under our care.

194
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,430
We will observe God's unjunctions and the
instructions given to us by God's messenger,

195
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,490
his first successor
and Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

196
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,190
You shall not be force to convert to Islam.
Your lives and property would be safe.

197
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,730
will leave you to run your land
as you please,

198
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,670
with full autonomy as long as you
administer justice in your land.

199
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,490
If you wish to refer anything to us
for judgement,

200
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,760
we will give such judgement according
to our law which applies to us.

201
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,450
We do not impose on you any tribute
or land tax more than you can pay.

202
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:14,770
The tribute we call jizyah is less than
the zakat which is a duty applicable to us

203
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,770
and an act of worship.

204
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,630
Were we to impose it on you in line
with what is a duty to Muslims,

205
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,990
it would be taken as an act of religious
imposition. This is forbidden in Islam.

206
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,490
God says: 'No compulsion is admissible
in matters of religion'.

207
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,110
We also pledge to you that we will
protect you from our common enemies.

208
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,210
If we cannot, we take nothing from you.

209
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,550
We accept these terms.

210
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,550
As for provisions and supplies,
we have enough to last us six months.

211
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,250
Soon winter will come and they
cannot tolerate the cold weather,

212
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,250
considering that they come from
a hot desert climate.

213
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,810
They do not have the machines
used in siege which we know.

214
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:08,430

This means that we are safe within the city.

215
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,780
Return the milk to him.

216
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,650
This milk has been adulterated with water.

217
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,380
Do you not know that such cheating
is forbidden and God punishes for it

218
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,700
Give her back his money.

219
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,220
If you wish, take the milk home
and give it to your family.

220
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,880
If you do not, I will pour it here

221
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,070
and give orders for you to be flogged
in front of the people in the market.

222
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:38,570
If you do it again, I will kick you out
of the market and punish you severely.

223
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,960
Why do you interfere in my work?
Who are you to give orders?

224
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,600
All glory to God. Cheating and arrogance

225
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,990
Pardon me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
but this woman...

226
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,240
Didn't I promise to appoint officials
to watch how business is conducted

227
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,690
and to settle disputes between people

228
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:05,220
This woman is As-Shifa Bint Abdullah. I have
appointed her as controller of your market.

229
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,520
Whatever she rules is my ruling.

230
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,850
Any punishment she orders is my order.

231
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,330
If any of you is unsure of what is permissible
and what is forbidden regarding anything

232
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,050
should ask her.

233
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:30,650
she is competent,
and she enjoys my full trust.

234
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,530
What have you ruled in this man's case?

235
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,930
That he gives his milk to his own family,
or we will spill it.

236
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,730
If he does it again, we flog him
and kick him out of the market.

237
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,450
Had I seen him first
I would have flogged him first,

238
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,190
but now we approve As-Shifa's ruling.
Obey her.

239
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,500
Now return to your work.

240
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,500
Return the milk to him.

241
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,900
What is this?
A blessing from God.

242
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,600
Rather, punishment by God.

243
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,850
I say to all of you:

244
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,210
guard yourselves against getting fat,

245
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,410
because that will make you slacken
for prayer, and it spoils your bodies,

246
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,890
and brings you illnesses.

247
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:47,590
Eat moderately, for that helps you to be well
and keeps you from extravagance.

248
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,590
You will be better able
to conduct you worship

249
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:41,400
Your highness, Princess Buran.
At last, Commander Rustom.

250
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,930
You haven't let me down.

251
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,780
When I wrote to you in Khurasan,

252
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,580
I was certain that you are the one to save our kingdom.

253
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,150
I would not have undertaken
this responsibility

254
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,950
except for the fat that the scheming
of Queen Azarmidukht

255
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,650
and her commander Siyawakhsh
threatened to do away with all that

256
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,930
our forefathers have built
over a thousand years.

257
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,410
Then these noblemen grouped together and
placed the fate of the kingdom in my hand.

258
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:18,410
They know that I do not want to be queen,
but I want to save Persia.

259
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,250
Therefore, it was necessary to get rid
of Azarmidukht and her commander,

260
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,150
and to put and end to this long struggle
for the Persian throne.

261
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,750
This has been accomplished.

262
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,600
We have got rid of Azarmidukht
and Siyawakhsh the murderer.

263
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,170
My father was the first victim.

264
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,170
Nothing pleased me more than killing him
in revenge of my father

265
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,250
and for what he perpetrated.

266
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,550
These noblemen have done well to join you.
I am one of them to serve you.

267
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,990
Just give me your orders.

268
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:10,330
This is not the milk of my she-camel.
It tastes different.

269
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,330
Indeed, Ameer Al-Mu'mineed.
Where did you get it, man?

270
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,830
Your she-camel, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,
was left dry by her calf.

271
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,130
I milked for you one
of the she-camels of the state.

272
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,590
How dare you give me a drink of fire?
Are you not one of the Muslim community?

273
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,190
You have the right to your share in
the state property like any one of them.

274
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,890
It is just a drink of milk.

275
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,680
Nothing of the state property
is permissible for me other

276
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,580
than what I get the people's approval of.

277
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,790
Then get them to approve what you need
for your living and your family.

278
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,190
We have suffered much since you
have taken charge of the state.

279
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,640
You have abandoned your business
to attend to the affairs of the people.

280
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,430
We do not find enough to eat, and no
allowance has been given to you so far.

281
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,230
How shall we live?

282
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,930
They could not have reached
this stage without our help.

283
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,930
Our great kings have gone,

284
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,180
and their throne became
the property of the winner.

285
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,790
Every prince tries to overthrow
the incumbent.

286
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:09,790
Little do they realize that they may lose
the throne itself ot the Arabs.

287
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,640
Yes, commander.

288
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,080
Unless we are reunited, we will soon
see them besieging Al-Mada'in.

289
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,470
Could a day come when the Arabs are
the rules of Persia and we are their slaves?

290
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,510
Isn't death better than that?
Yes, Your highness. Death is better.

291
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,790
Well, make up your minds
before it is too late.

292
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,440
We have heard that they have raised another
army which is on its way to Al-Heerah

293
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,230
to join their army already there.

294
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,890
You know, Your highness, that the surviving
descendant of Khosrau Parves

295
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,390
has disappeared, fearing for his life,
after Shirweih killed his father the Khosrau

296
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,790
and his father's male offspring.

297
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,000
Then we plunged into what you know
of the other princes' rivalries for the throne.

298
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,900
They resorted to treachery and internal war.

299
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,900
Khosrau's descendants have the rightful
claim to the throne of Persia.

300
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,220
However, the present time
and circumstances

301
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,450
do not allow us a chance to search
for them and appointing one of them.

302
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,450
You are the only one who can unite us now.

303
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,250
I think you should assume the throne
for a period of ten years,

304
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,670
so that we can get rid of that Arab threat
and regain stability.

305
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,830
Then the kingdom may go back
to the descendants of Khosrau.

306
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,830
Yes, this is right.

307
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,630
If this is the only way,

308
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,030
then Commander Rustom is my minister
and the Commander-in-Chief.

309
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,330
I authorize him to manage the affairs
of the state on war footing.

310
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,610
Al-Fairuzan will be his deputy,

311
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,510
to manage the affairs of the state
when Rustom leads his armies.

312
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,360
Your throne, your majesty.

313
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,360
I pledge to you that I will defend
it with all my power.

314
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:26,160
The destiny of Persia is now in your hand,
minister and commander!

315
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,900
I promised you that I would take nothing
from the treasury

316
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,540
while I have enough of my own.
Now my money is gone.

317
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,010
What am I allowed to have
from the treasury?

318
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,310
Ameer al-Mu'mineen knows this
better than us.

319
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,710
Say what you think. we either accept
or tell you what we think.

320
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,630
The mount I need to travel
for pilgrimage or Umrah,

321
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,680
and my two robes for summer
and two robes for winter,

322
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:08,680
the food for my family,
and my share as a Muslim individual.

323
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,680
This is fair.

324
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,400
Do you all agree to this?
Yes.

325
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,690
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, the one who
is most entitled to have good food,

326
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,490
comfortable mount, fine clothes is you.

327
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,490
By God I do not think you said this
in honesty to God.

328
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,190
You only said it to have some favour
with me. I used to think well of you.

329
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,790
Do you know, man,
what my standing with these people is?

330
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,750
It is like a group of people travelling
together. They gave their expenses

331
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,910
to one of them and told him
to look after them.

332
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,980
It is permissible for him to take
of it something extra for himself?

333
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,980
No.
This is my case with them.

334
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:01,500
Why is this man walking in such a way?

335
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,500
Since when has devotion meant
a faint walk and a miserable look?

336
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,500
You are killing our religion, may God kill you.

337
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,400
Walk upright and show the dignity of Islam.

338
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,960
How come that some people think
that devotion means looking dead,

339
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,450
in the midst of the living?

340
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,770
Why would they speak softly,
bend their heads when walking,

341
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:34,090
and drop their heads
and shoulders in prayer?

342
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:39,950
Do they not fear that they may be
suspected of hypocrisy?

343
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,950
Hypocrisy may be in a show of piety
just as it may be in arrogance?

344
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,010
Both aim to show others
that one is better than them,

345
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,450
either in religion
or in what relates to the present life.

346
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,090
We have learnt that the new Muslim army
has not arrived in Iraq yet.

347
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,510
Their resident commander
at Al-Heerah, I mean...

348
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,950
Al-Muthanna
Yes

349
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,050
He has only a few thousand soldiers.

350
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:09,750
We better attack them
before the new reinforcements arrive.

351
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,010
We will send two armies: one goes
to Al-Heerah, commanded by Jaban.

352
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,850
The other army joins the force
between the two rivers.

353
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,970
Its commander will be Nersi.

354
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,490
I thought you would go
at the head of the armies.

355
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,220
No.

356
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,520
My plan is to send several armies,
one following the other.

357
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,770
This is harder for the enemy.

358
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:42,410
I fear that the princes, or commanders,
might be plotting against Princess Buran.

359
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,410
We have seen what others did.

360
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,310
They represent a greater danger
to the state than the Muslims.

361
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,310
I will discharge both responsibilities.
Let no one entertain any doubt.

362
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,400
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

363
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,850
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

364
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,170
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

365
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,370
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

366
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

367
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,060
God is supreme.
God is supreme.

368
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,150
Your face tells me that your news
is not good. Say it.

369
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,990
It is the worst news.

370
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,100
Jaban's army has been defeated
at Al-Namariq,

371
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,630
then Nersi's army was defeated first
at Al-Saqqatiyyah in Kaskar,

372
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,130
then at Baruka.

373
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,530
The Muslims then smashed Jalinus's army
which set out to reinforce Nersi.

374
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,320
The Muslims defeated four of our armies
in less than a month.

375
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,560
They regained the entire countryside
before conquering the city of Kaskar.

376
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,040
What has happened to Persia
which had previously defeated all corners?

377
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,760
Where are our soldiers who used to
spread panic wherever they went?

378
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,440
No. The fault is not with the soldiers;

379
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,560
It is with the commanders who want to
lead the soldiers to great victories

380
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,440
while they remain in their palaces here
at Al-Mada'in.

381
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
You mean Rustom.
Yes, Rustom.

382
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,600
Your majesty made him
Commander-in-chief and minister,

383
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,000
assigning to him the task of managing
the affairs of the state.

384
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,600
I advised him to raise the armies
and go out himself, but he refused.

385
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,360
Now we have the outcome,
one defeat after another.

386
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,640
The Muslims are now in control
of the whole of Iraq, north to south.

387
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
Show us how they work.

388
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:04,640
The traitors!

389
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,640
By God, if the Muslims are turned back,

390
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,000
I shall punish all Syrian Arabs
who have helped them.

391
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,200
I shall crucify them in every city.

392
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,840
They have seen their brethern outside
the city siding with the Muslims.

393
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,240
I have no doubt that some of them here
communicate to their Arab brothers

394
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,760
outside news of what take place here
in Damascus.

395
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,000
Haven't I ordered that spies
should move among them?

396
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,480
Whoever they determine to be favouring
their own people over us

397
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,520
should be made a lesson to all others.

398
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,680
I have placed you ahead
of all commanders and princes.

399
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,040
I went against other people's advice.

400
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,040
I was content to allow you to manage
matters on a war footing.

401
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,520
I do not wish to say that I am let down,
but... such successive defeats!

402
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,440
The war is still evenly balanced,
your majesty

403
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,480
I am the one who is let down by Nersi,
Jaban, Jalinus and the tax collectors.

404
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,440
But you are the commander-in-chief, and
whatever these do will be attributed to you,

405
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,800
in victory or defeat.

406
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,120
You know that some princes and
commanders are watching what you do.

407
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,440
They have started whispering.
I do not know how to respond to them.

408
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,560
It is al-Fairuzan. I know that he is
the one who tries to undermine me.

409
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,840
He is jealous of my standing with you,

410
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,680
and would prefer that I should dissapear,
even if this meant that Persia is gone as well.

411
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,520
Don't you see, your majesty?
It is because of this that I preferred

412
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,760
that I do not go myself at this stage
to fight the Muslims.

413
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,920
If I did, I would be playing into his
and his friends' hands.

414
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,280
They would be able to plot against me
when I am away.

415
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,880
If they did when we are at war,
then the whole future of Persia is gone.

416
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,960
If you want me to sack him now,
that will only precipitate what you fear.

417
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,400
You know that he has supporters.

418
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,760
If he is sacked, they will revolt
against me and you.

419
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,720
That will be the end of Persia.

420
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,960
What is needed is that you should achieve
a great victory over the Muslims.

421
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,600
Victory in the battlefield will be a victory
for us over those who have ambitions here.


422
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,560
The two go hand in hand.
There is no other way.
