00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:04,480
Farouk Omar
(Omar Ibn Al-Khattab)

2
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:09,200
Episode 25.

3
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,280
"Caution: The following show contains
disturbing images for young children"

4
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:29,906
What separate us
are the river and the bridge.

5
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:36,062
You either cross over to us
or we cross over to you.

6
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:52,462
They say that either we or they
cross over to the other side.

7
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:57,551
Tell them to cross over to us.

8
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:01,960
They do not dare death more than us.
We will cross over.

9
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,908
I appeal to you to reconsider, Abu Ubaid.

10
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:09,159
Abu Ubaid, they are known
for their wickedness and trickery.

11
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:11,056
I do not think they will wait

12
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,881
until we have completed the crossing
and marshalled our troops.

13
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,994
They will attack us
when we are unprepared.

14
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,101
What is the matter with you?

15
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:19,207
Are you afraid?

16
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:22,144
If we do not cross over,
they will think that we have weakened,

17
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:25,431
and this will boost their morale.
That is half the victory.

18
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:28,601
I have made up my mind,
so you obey my orders.

19
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,797
Hold it! Hold it!

20
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:02,980
Hold it! Hold it!

21
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,408
Don't be afraid! Stop!

22
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,167
- God is Supreme!
- God is Supreme!

23
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:14,148
- God is Supreme!
- God is Supreme!

24
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,049
God is Supreme! God is Supreme!

25
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:48,503
We are standing there giving you cover
until you have gone back.

26
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,875
Cross back in an orderly way.

27
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,845
God is Supreme! God is Supreme!

28
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,296
Indeed, we won at the bridge,
but with six thousands of our men killed.

29
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,130
Six thousands killed

30
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,878
despite the Muslims being cornered
in a narrow area at the bridge.

31
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,627
What would have happened
had we met them in an open area,

32
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:50,096
or if they did not choose
to cross over to our army?

33
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,587
Then what happened after that?

34
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,884
Why has Commander Bahman returned
with the majority of the army to Al-Mada'in,

35
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,332
when he could have chased the Muslims

36
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,334
who were much weakened
and exterminate them all?

37
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:11,320
He only sent a section of the army
with Jaban and Mirdenshah to chase them.

38
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:16,710
They were fewer than necessary
for a victory,

39
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:23,043
And the result? A defeat
that has wiped away the earlier victory,

40
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:28,773
and the loss of two of our best commanders:
Jaban and Mirdenshah.

41
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:35,069
All this because Bahman preferred
to return with the bulk of the army,

42
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,491
letting this opportunity disappear.

43
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:40,996
I thought that the Muslims
who survived the Battle of the Bridge

44
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:46,023
were too weak to resist the force
I sent with Jaban and Mirdenshah.

45
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,993
Now we know that you have miscalculated.

46
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:52,444
Why don't you come out
with the truth, Commander?

47
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,481
Why don't you say that the minister
and Commander-in-Chief, Rustom,

48
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:03,016
wrote to you instructing you
to return straightaway?

49
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:07,429
Had we been spared the plots and schemes
of some of the princes and commanders,

50
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,946
I would have done that.

51
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,865
My duty, however,
is to fight on two fronts at the same time.

52
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,664
Both wars are interlinked:
against the Muslims there

53
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,509
and against the enemies
of the kingdom here.

54
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,246
Who are these princes and commanders?

55
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:24,040
Why don't you name them so that we move
to arrest them and kill them?

56
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:27,333
Or do you mean me?

57
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:31,464
You are not more loyal
to her majesty than me.

58
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:36,194
If you have evidence to suggest
that I am a traitor, produce it

59
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,984
and I will submit myself
to her majesty's decision.

60
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,289
Enough of this dispute which threatens
the very existence of our kingdom.

61
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:47,323
I placed my trust in you both.

62
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:51,365
Now you should better know
that I will not side with either of you,

63
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,158
no matter how you try.

64
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,537
If this is not brought to end,

65
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,150
I will relinquish the throne
and let things work themselves out.

66
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:04,743
I do not wish to be blamed
for the final fall of the Persian Empire.

67
00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:12,201
Are you going to the mosque wearing this?

68
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,327
Isn't it enough to clothe me
and protect me from heat and cold?

69
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,720
My allowance gives me two robes.

70
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,605
The other one is in the same condition.

71
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,450
You can request your companions
to allow you a third.

72
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,146
I will never do.

73
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:29,575
But, you!

74
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,826
Wouldn't you rather pray at home?

75
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,450
You know what I like.

76
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,283
Do you want me to relinquish
the reward of collective prayer

77
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,575
and to miss what Ameer Al-Mu'Mineen
says to admonish people?

78
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,043
It it must be done,
then keep it to the day prayers,

79
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,093
not the dawn and the night prayers.

80
00:11:48,137 --> 00:11:50,251
Do you mean this as a prohibition?

81
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,391
Umar would never prohibit something
the Prophet allowed.

82
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:57,171
He said: "Do not prohibit women
to attend mosques."

83
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,939
Who goes first: you or I?

84
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,392
It is better that people should be
in the mosque ahead of the imam.

85
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:23,424
Ameer Al-Mu'Mineen!

86
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:27,091
People are demanding high dowries,
and we are unable to get married.

87
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:28,731
Would you kindly admonish them?

88
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:36,278
Some of you have complained to me
about people asking high dowries,

89
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:44,334
making it difficult for young people
to get married.

90
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:52,107
Do not ask
for more than 400 dirhams in dowry,

91
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:56,153
even if the bride is the daughter
of one of your chiefs.

92
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,507
Anyone who asks more,

93
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:00,912
I will take the extra
and add it to the state treasury.

94
00:13:01,136 --> 00:13:01,743
What?

95
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:04,241
This is not up to you,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

96
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,405
- Why not?

97
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,743
- Because God says: "If you wish
to take one wife in place of another"

98
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:16,796
"and you have given the first one
a large sum of money,"

99
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,794
"do not take away anything of it."

100
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:21,467
"Would you take it away"

101
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:24,234
"though that constitutes a gross injustice
and a manifest sin?" (Surah An-Nisa, verse 20)

102
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:31,060
How can you, then, threaten to take
any excess of the limit you have imposed

103
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,060
and put it in the state treasury?

104
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:39,436
A woman is right, and a man is wrong.

105
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,894
May God forgive me.

106
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,246
Everyone is more learned than Umar.

107
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:53,861
Let me make it clear
that I take back what I said.

108
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,228
Whoever wants to give of his money
any amount he is happy to give may do so.

109
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:05,651
But anyone who seeks
to make it easy for young Muslims

110
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:09,091
will hope that God
will make it easy for him.

111
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,013
Here is Abdullah Ibn Zaid,
who is one of Abu Ubaid's men in Iraq.

112
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,361
What news do you bring Abdullah?

113
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,179
The news has arrived,
after the prayer, God willing.

114
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:47,189
All power operates by God's will.

115
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,484
May God bestow His mercy on Abu Ubaid.

116
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:56,388
Had he abandoned his position
and come to me,

117
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:59,560
after seeing the huge number of the
Byzantines and the little number of his army

118
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,179
I would have been his reinforcement

119
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,479
and I would then have called
on people to join him.

120
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:09,813
As for Al-Muthanna, I pray that God
will grant him generous reward.

121
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,298
He has proved himself worthy
of the description

122
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:21,125
that makes him a man of noble descent
and personal distinction.

123
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:27,469
He began the struggle in Iraq
before our forces set out there.

124
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:34,286
He then agreed to serve under Khalid,
then under Abu Ubaid.

125
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,873
He never sought to be the commander,

126
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,420
even though he was in the forefront
of the fight against the Persians.

127
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,555
By God, we shall not let him down,
now that he is requesting reinforcements.

128
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:53,066
We will send him one force
and army after another,

129
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:57,720
even if this means
that I should go myself.

130
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:04,758
Let us send callers to jihad
to all Arab tribes, wherever they are.

131
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,583
We agreed that
I would rule for ten years,

132
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,801
then we'll try to find one of the descendants
of Khosrau Parvez who disappeared

133
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:49,934
I have come to know
that among their survivors

134
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:53,903
is a grandson of Khosrau Parvez
called Yizdegird,

135
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:59,758
son of Shahryar who was one
of those killed by his brother Shirweih.

136
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,463
His mother managed to flee with him

137
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,541
and hid him with her family in Istakhr.

138
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:10,189
He is the last male of the descendents
of Khosrau and the Sassanides.

139
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,596
I have decided not to wait for ten years.

140
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,853
It appears to me that these commanders,

141
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:21,824
and the public,

142
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:28,086
will not be truly united unless they are under
a strong man of Khosrau's descendents.

143
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,867
In that case, they will not hope
to control a woman like myself.

144
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,109
If the throne of Khosrau is occupied
by the one who has the rightful claim to it,

145
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,280
and the people are united under him,

146
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:42,792
these commanders will no longer hope
to have a share of the throne.

147
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:45,386
They will then attend to their proper task,

148
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:48,342
which is the war and nothing else.

149
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,684
I have tried,

150
00:18:02,745 --> 00:18:06,108
and I had no interest
other than the fate of Persia

151
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,107
and the legacy of its kings.

152
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:18,346
But... I was here managing
as best as I could,

153
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:23,202
with great resources and riches
at my disposal,

154
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,935
as well as the heritage
of a thousand years or more

155
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:29,677
of the glory and greatness of Persia.

156
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:36,623
Yet, far away in the Muslim's capital,

157
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:42,750
in the desert land of poverty,
mud houses and hair tents,

158
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:48,737
there is their top prince,
whom they call Caliph,

159
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,531
managing as well.

160
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,415
I must admit now
that he has defeated me.

161
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:08,162
It is right, then, that I should step down
and be lost to memory.

162
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,844
I wish I could see with my own eyes
the man who has defeated me,

163
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:20,102
so as to know what sort of person he is.

164
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:23,828
I would like to know whether his
commanders and soldiers were able to win

165
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,089
because of him,
or he won because of them,

166
00:19:28,392 --> 00:19:32,587
or is their victory due to them all.

167
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,762
Will you take me with you, young man?

168
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,065
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

169
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,530
Do ride please, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

170
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:56,344
No. You ride and I will ride behind you.

171
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:59,906
No one shall see me riding
with Ameer Al-Mu'mineen behind me.

172
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:02,796
Do you want me
to be at the more comfortable place

173
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,551
while you be at the less comfortable?

174
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,734
Come on! Do as you are told.

175
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,578
- Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!
- Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

176
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,614
Let me down.

177
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:42,458
You may go now.

178
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:45,125
I would rather wait for you
and take you back with me.

179
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,678
God bless you. You better go.

180
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:51,881
This is your best day since you were born,

181
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:54,283
if only you could realize.
He is Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

182
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:58,274
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!
Peace be to you with God's mercy.

183
00:20:58,582 --> 00:21:00,657
And to you be peace with God's mercy.

184
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,613
I have come to inspect
the charity camels and this meadow.

185
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,505
How are you doing?

186
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:08,761
As you have instructed,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

187
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,681
We do not prevent anyone
with camels to come and graze.

188
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:13,456
And no distinction between people?

189
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,801
They are all equal in grazing
and the water spring.

190
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:21,881
This is the right way to do.
The place is owned by all Muslims.

191
00:21:22,928 --> 00:21:25,446
Is it enough to accommodate
the charity camels and people's camels?

192
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,180
Yes, so far.

193
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:30,487
We have to organize their turns
at the water, though.

194
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:36,249
If the numbers of charity camels
and people's camels increase,

195
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:38,892
the meadow may be too small for them all.

196
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:45,820
Whose land is that?

197
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:50,383
It belongs to Bilal Ibn Al-Harith.
God's Messenger gave it to him.

198
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,411
It is not planted with any plants
or date trees.

199
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,888
It is large.

200
00:21:57,177 --> 00:22:00,115
Bilal has reclaimed a portion of it
and left a portion

201
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,353
as he is unable to look after the entire plot.

202
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,056
Find him and send him to me.

203
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:29,199
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

204
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:33,950
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen... by God,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen...

205
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,074
it is only what the wind drops.

206
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,513
I neither picked it up by hand
nor threw a stone. By God...

207
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,893
You have not lied to me.
What is your name?

208
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,176
Sinan Ibn Salamah Al-Hudhali.

209
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,341
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

210
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,168
The boys will now come at me
and take what I have. By God...

211
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,060
No. Walk with me and I will take you home.

212
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:07,980
What will you do with these dates?

213
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,374
I share it with my mother and sister.

214
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,966
- Equally?
- Equally. By God, in fairness.

215
00:23:14,214 --> 00:23:16,317
I count them all. By God.

216
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,673
Don't you think that you swear too often?

217
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:22,109
It is not serious.
God does not hold us accoutable for it.

218
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,375
- Who taught you this?
- My mother.

219
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,309
She always attends the prayer
at the mosque.

220
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,142
She is teaching me the Qur'an.

221
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,336
She is a good mother,
and you should be a dutiful son.

222
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:37,001
Nevertheless, do not get
into the habit of swearing,

223
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,202
as this could lead you into a sinful practice.

224
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,056
I will, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

225
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:46,994
- Is this a promise?
- Yes, a promise. By God...

226
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,354
I forgot. I forgot. By God, I forgot.

227
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,727
You have not mentioned your father.

228
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:01,621
He is in the army in Iraq.

229
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,174
Really?

230
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:12,545
How can Ameer Al-Mu'mineen
remember all his subjects?

231
00:24:14,684 --> 00:24:17,566
From my share, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

232
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,766
You are giving me some of your share?

233
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:25,419
One only. To share the blessing
of the food of a true family,

234
00:24:25,707 --> 00:24:32,346
with a man on jihad, a goodly wife
and a son who will be blessed, God willing.

235
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:46,509
Call your mother to come to the door.
I want to speak to her.

236
00:24:47,015 --> 00:24:50,474
I will. Mother! Mother!

237
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:58,607
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?
Has my son misbehaved?

238
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:01,775
No. You have brought him up well.

239
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,478
I have just learnt
that your husband is away.

240
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,613
How are you doing?
Do you need anything?

241
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:14,051
We are fine, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

242
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:16,489
Our allowance comes regularly,
by God's grace

243
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,734
and as Ameer Al-Mu'mineen
shares things out.

244
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:21,660
I consider myself the father
of all dependents, sister.

245
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:24,245
I hate that women whose husbands
are on campaigns of jihad

246
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,220
should be cheated in buying or selling
things while their husbands are away.

247
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,370
Whoever wants to buy something

248
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:32,886
can send with me anyone
of her children or servants

249
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,944
and I will buy their things for them.
Do you need anything?

250
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:52,815
Peace be to Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

251
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,474
And to you be peace with God's mercy.

252
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,246
How do you find the people of the market?

253
00:25:57,525 --> 00:26:02,566
Would anyone dare to cheat
when Al-Shifa' Bint Abdullah is the controller

254
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:05,209
and Umar Ibn Al-Khattab
is Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

255
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,136
I see with you the boys and girls of the
women whose husbands are away, as usual.

256
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:16,164
How about dividing the task between us:

257
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:19,762
I will attend to some
and you attend to the others.

258
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:23,162
We will thus buy their things for them
and you won't lose much time.

259
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:29,017
Now, who goes with Al-Shifa'
and who stays with me?

260
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:31,871
I am with you Ameer Al-Mu'mineen;

261
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:36,964
You don't want to be with me,
Al-Shifa', the controller of the market?

262
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:39,950
All this, and you are Umar,

263
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:43,570
whom people always say
how strict and awesome he is.

264
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:46,244
You might as well add how hard he is.

265
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:50,716
That is your own description of yourself,
and I do not believe it.

266
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,323
Peace be to you with God's mercy.

267
00:27:01,543 --> 00:27:02,894
And to you be peace with God's mercy.

268
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:05,014
You sent for me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

269
00:27:05,844 --> 00:27:07,559
Sit down, Bilal.

270
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:14,013
It is about that plot of land which you
requested the Prophet to give you

271
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:16,189
- and he did.
- What about it?

272
00:27:16,997 --> 00:27:19,689
I see you could not revive it all.

273
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,905
True. It is too large.

274
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,418
Then, consider what you can revive
and keep it.

275
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:31,045
What you cannot,

276
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:34,077
give it back so that
we can share it among Muslims.

277
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:38,153
I shall not do. It is something
that God's Messenger gave me.

278
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:43,107
You know that God's Messenger
never refused any request.

279
00:27:43,437 --> 00:27:46,169
He gave it to you so that you reclaim it

280
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:49,128
and it will give you enough food
for your family and for poor people.

281
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,408
Its zakat will also go to the poor and needy.

282
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:52,985
This is the purpose.

283
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:58,111
If you are unable to reclaim it, or a portion
of it, then the purpose has failed.

284
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,254
You are not earning a living through it
and you are not benefitting others.

285
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:08,427
- If I am unfair, correct me.
- By God, you are fair.

286
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,022
I am urging you, so do it.
The matter is settled.

287
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:22,567
"Damascus"

288
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:32,618
Do some of us still hope that an army
will be sent to us by the Emperor

289
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:34,990
to break this siege, after all these months?

290
00:28:35,351 --> 00:28:37,904
Food supplies are almost exhausted
at home and in the markets.

291
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:40,190
What would Nistas care about us,

292
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:42,868
when he and his friends have filled their
cupboards so that they won't go hungry?

293
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,003
How long will this siege last, then?

294
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:47,941
Are we waiting for the Muslims
to force their way in?

295
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:50,581
They will then apply to us the rules
that apply to fighters.

296
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,994
If the outcome is inevitable,

297
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,575
would it not be better for us to sue
for peace and ensure our safety

298
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:58,520
and the safety of our families and property?

299
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:02,131
What I fear is that
if they defeat the Byzantines,

300
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,451
the people here will adopt
their faith by choice.

301
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:06,648
This has started indeed.

302
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,227
What is wrong with a person
choosing his religion,

303
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:11,307
as long as he is not forced?

304
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:15,551
If we side with the Byzantines
against the Muslim Arabs,

305
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,789
preferring the injustice of the Byzantines
over the justice of the Muslims

306
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:23,086
only because we want to prevent people
choosing their faith freely,

307
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,306
then we will be guilty of compulsion.

308
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:28,282
And what have you chosen?

309
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:38,103
Yes, I embraced Islam when I learnt
of its message well before this siege began.

310
00:29:39,387 --> 00:29:41,733
If this makes me unacceptable among you,

311
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,515
I will leave you to your business.

312
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,700
I am only giving you the sort of advice
I give to my own family.

313
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:58,464
Move it! Move it! I said move it! Come on!

314
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:04,579
Let me go! Let me go!

315
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,885
I haven't done anything! Leave me alone!

316
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,060
Let me go!

317
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:20,405
Let me go!

318
00:30:26,232 --> 00:30:28,010
Leave me alone!

319
00:30:30,214 --> 00:30:33,826
We are certain that these people
are in contact with the enemy,

320
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:35,673
and they deserve to be punished.

321
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:40,716
And these two are the ones
who have planned it all.

322
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:44,046
They deserve nothing less than death.

323
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,706
Why is this cruelty? What did they do?

324
00:30:57,596 --> 00:31:00,549
I bear witness
that there is no deity other than God,

325
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,795
and that Muhammad is God's Messenger.

326
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,392
Stop! Stop all this! These are our people.

327
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:33,847
Peace be to you with God's mercy.

328
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:39,926
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,
I have something to ask you.

329
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:43,917
I am one of your subjects, like all others.

330
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:47,067
What is it you ask?

331
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,240
I have incurred a debt
and I cannot repay it.

332
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,388
The lender is pressing me.

333
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,442
How much do you owe?

334
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,887
One hundred dirhams,
which I used for my daughter's wedding.

335
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:17,632
Your request is granted, God willing.

336
00:32:18,528 --> 00:32:21,446
But, may I ask what stops you
from embracing Islam

337
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:23,318
as other people have done?

338
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:27,748
I am an elderly woman.
Only very little of my life remains.

339
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:31,822
As you wish.

340
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:43,855
All power operates only by God's will.
All power operates only by God's will.

341
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,057
I plead for God's forgiveness.
I plead for God's forgiveness.

342
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,981
What have you done, Umar?

343
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,245
What are you requesting forgiveness for,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

344
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,543
An elderly Christian woman.
She had some business with me.

345
00:32:56,836 --> 00:33:00,758
I gave her what she needed,
but then I called on her to accept Islam.

346
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,329
But you haven't forced her, have you?

347
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,388
I feared that there was a touch of compulsion
by giving her what she asked for.

348
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,181
It all boils down to your intention,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

349
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,732
Actions are determined by intention.

350
00:33:15,313 --> 00:33:22,022
My Lord, You know that I only pointed
Your way, without compulsion.

351
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:26,506
Nevertheless, I fear that something is wrong.

352
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:29,426
May God forgive me.

353
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,886
"Istakhr"

354
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,021
Move aside, young man.

355
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:17,726
The pretty one is coquettish!

356
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,101
She doesn't think us fit company.

357
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:24,958
The day is fine, and the gardens are full.

358
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:27,495
All we want is
to pass some good time.

359
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:29,944
We could have fun together.

360
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:34,040
The pretty lady won't regret our company.

361
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:38,541
We have a store of funny things
to tell you.

362
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,507
Won't you stop, young man?

363
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,641
Not while the birds continue to sing,

364
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,306
the river to run, the bees to suckle
at the flowers,

365
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,540
and the pretty eye pelts my poor
loving heart with its arrows.

366
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,679
Won't you take pity on me
when you see me like this?

367
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,129
Will it please you to hear
that young Yizdejird

368
00:34:58,378 --> 00:35:00,646
has died of hopeless love?

369
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,707
Or is it true that the pretty one
has no heart?

370
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,350
I see that you won't stop
until a calamity befalls you.

371
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:12,429
Calamity? Who will bring me a calamity?
You? Please do.

372
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,661
No. These two.

373
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:22,514
Who are these? No... what are these?

374
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:25,209
Your instructions, madam.
What shall we do with him?

375
00:35:25,576 --> 00:35:28,834
Just remove him from our way.
But do not harm him.

376
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:31,256
Ok, I will remove myself.

377
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,567
Well, where are your beards
and moustaches?

378
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:38,558
Oh, yes! You are eunuch (emasculate).

379
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:42,110
No wonder, you do not know
that a young man could die of love.

380
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,978
But I know how a young man dies
because of his bad manners.

381
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:52,187
Stop it! Anyone who touches his majesty
the king shall receive his punishment.

382
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,101
His majesty, the king?

383
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,492
Your majesty King
Yizdejird Ibn Shahriyar Ibn Khosrau Parvez.

384
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:33,323
Do you see this?

385
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:37,646
They seem to be travellers
who stopped here.

386
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:42,592
Let us go and see them.

387
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:51,135
- Peace be to you.

388
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:54,165
- And to you be peace.

389
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,163
May I come closer?

390
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:58,634
Come, if you bring some good,
or else, leave.

391
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,183
Why are these boys crying?

392
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,383
They are hungry.

393
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:17,262
What have you got in this saucepan?

394
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:20,540
Water. I am trying to pacify them
until they sleep.

395
00:39:20,855 --> 00:39:22,830
God will judge between us and Umar.

396
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,769
You, woman...

397
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,075
God's mercy.
How can Umar know about you?

398
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,276
He takes charge of us,
but remains unaware of us.

399
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:37,360
Relief is near, woman.

400
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,471
Stay here until I come back
with something for you.

401
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:20,642
- Lift it on my back.
- I will carry it for you.

402
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:24,249
Will you carry my burden
on the Day of Judgement?

403
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,968
Drop the flour and I will stir.

404
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:52,633
Not like this. Drop it little by little
as I am stirring,

405
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:57,219
so that the mixture will be consistent.

406
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:00,357
It should not form small or large balls.

407
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:04,772
This is how this dish is made.

408
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:35,619
Feed them. I will dish out
a little at a time so that it cools.

409
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:42,377
Come here, son. Eat, eat.

410
00:42:49,587 --> 00:42:51,953
May God reward you well, man.

411
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,940
You would have been a better choice
than Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

412
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,422
Say only what is good.

413
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:05,664
Tomorrow, go and see Ameer Al-Mu'mineen
and you will find me there.

414
00:43:07,664 --> 00:43:09,774
He will provide for you, God willing.

415
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:17,169
Farouk Omar
