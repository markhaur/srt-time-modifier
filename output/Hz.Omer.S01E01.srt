1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,319
I respond to You, my Lord.

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,319
I respond to You as You have no partner.

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,719
All praise is due to You;

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,880
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,480
You have no partner.

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,680
I respond to You, my Lord.

7
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,719
I respond to You as You have no partner.

8
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,360
All praise is due to You;

9
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,520
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

10
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,799
You have no partner.

11
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,560
I respond to You, my Lord.

12
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,439
I respond to You as You have no partner.

13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,840
All praise is due to You;

14
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,319
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,719
You have no partner.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,920
I respond to You, my Lord.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,639
I respond to You as You have no partner.

18
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,199
All praise is due to You;

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,360
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

20
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,800
You have no partner.

21
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,960
I respond to You, my Lord.

22
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,759
I respond to You as You have no partner.

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
All praise is due to You;

24
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,319
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,280
You have no partner.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,160
I respond to You, my Lord.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,200
I respond to You as You have no partner.

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
All praise is due to You;

29
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,039
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

30
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,560
You have no partner.

31
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,719
I respond to You, my Lord.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,760
I respond to You as You have no partner.

33
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
All praise is due to You;

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

35
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,919
You have no partner.

36
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:42,199
My Lord, give me neither too much nor too little of the riches of this world,

37
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,159
so that I may neither overstep my limits nor forget my responsibilities.

38
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,120
A small but sufficient amount is better than what is plentiful but causes distraction.

39
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,039
My Lord, I have advanced in age, and lost much of my strength,

40
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,639
while my subjects have increased.

41
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,920
Gather me to You while I am able to fulfill my responsibilities, abandoning none.

42
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,799
A ruler's most important duty towards his people

43
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,800
is to give priority to their duties towards God,

44
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,879
as outlined in their religion representing His guidance.

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,480
It is our task to bid you to fulfill what God has commanded you

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,079
as His obedient servants,

47
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,639
and to refrain from sinful disobedience to Him.

48
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,759
We also have to implement God's commandments

49
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,560
as they apply equally to all people, in complete fulfillment of justice.

50
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,080
In so doing, we provide a chance for the ignorant to learn,

51
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,840
the careless to take heed and the one seeking lead to follow suit...

52
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,560
To be a true believer is not achieved by wishful thinking,

53
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,759
but by clear action.

54
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,000
The more diligent people are, the greater is their reward from God.

55
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,040
Jihad is the topmost duty of all.

56
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,360
The people who are truly engaged in jihad are those who abandon sinful practices

57
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,519
and whoever indulges in them.

58
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,439
Some people claim to have participated in jihad,

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,480
but true jihad for God's cause is to steer away from sin,

60
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,719
Nothing is dearer to God Almighty and of greater benefit to mankind

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,360
than a ruler's kindness based on true knowledge and insight.

62
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Nothing is more hateful to God than a ruler's ignorance and stupidity.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,920
By God, I do not appoint governors and officials in your provinces

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,639
so that they will beat you up or take away your money.

65
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,639
I send them to you to instruct you in your faith

66
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,000
and teach you the way the Prophet has shown us.

67
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
Whoever is treated differently should put their complaints to me.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,640
By God who holds my soul in His hand, I will ensure that justice is done to them.

69
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,160
If I fail to do so, I become a partner in such injustice.

70
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
It is much better for me to remove a governor every day

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,399
than to leave a despot in his position for an hour longer.

72
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,759
To replace governors is much easier than to change the people.

73
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,719
If setting things right for a community requires

74
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,639
replacing their governor, then it is certainly easy.

75
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,200
Therefore, whoever is in a position of authority in any area of people's affairs

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,439
must fear God in the way he treats his people.

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
To all these I say, do not beat people up to humiliate them.

78
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,199
Do not deny them their rights, showing them little care,

79
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,160
and do not place them in hardship making them feel lost.

80
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,160
My people, when you have completed your pilgrimage rituals,

81
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,759
let the people of different regions meet me together with their governors and officials

82
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,359
so that I can look into their situations.

83
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,039
I will consider their disputes and give my judgment,

84
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,320
making sure that the weak are given their rights and justice is done to all.

85
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,759
Would you like to stop here for rest, Sir?

86
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,399
What makes you tearful, Sir?

87
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,639
My feeling of gratitude to God for His boundless grace,

88
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,399
and my fear of being tested with it.

89
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,640
There is no deity other than God Almighty,

90
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,080
who grants whatever He pleases to whomever He wills.

91
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,519
I can look at myself tending Al-Khattab's camels in this valley,

92
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,919
He was a rough, hard man, working me to exhaustion

93
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
and beating me up if I slackened.

94
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,920
Now...

95
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,760
I am in my position with no one to stand between me and God.

96
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,120
"6 years before the mission of the Prophet"

97
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,839
May we water our animals at your well, young man?

98
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,319
Who are you, people?

99
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,079
We belong to the tribe of Khuzaah

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
What if I refuse?

101
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
Then we will go back in peace,

102
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,679
hoping to find what we want with some noble person.

103
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,560
A noble man gives for a gentle approach what he denies for a rough one.

104
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
When we have finished and begun to move our camels away,

105
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,639
you may bring in your camels. You are most welcome.

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,080
May I know the name of the generous young man?

107
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,240
Umar... Umar Ibn Al-Khattab

108
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
Of which clan of Quraysh?

109
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,399
And you know that I belong to the Quraysh?

110
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
The Qurayshi looks cannot be mistaken.

111
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,639
- I belong to the clan of Adiyy. - Kind and noble people.

112
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,240
Umar!

113
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
Here is the firewood you need, aunt. Shall I bring it in?

114
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,120
Leave it here for now.

115
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,879
Won't you come in and have something to eat?

116
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,080
No, I won't eat until I have delivered the rest of the firewood to my other aunts.

117
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,839
I must not be late returning to Al-Khattab's camels.

118
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,919
Otherwise, he will be angry.

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,879
If you like, we would speak to him to reduce your work.

120
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,560
I do not wish for lighter work, but for a strong body.

121
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,679
This you have been given.

122
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,639
May God give you increased strength, you son of Hantamah.

123
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
Wait a moment, Umar.

124
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,479
This is for you: dates from Yathrib and raisins from Taif.

125
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,080
What brings you home at this time?

126
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,360
What about the camels...

127
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
I gathered some firewood for my maternal aunts...

128
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,519
What about the camels?

129
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,679
Your camels are all right

130
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,879
Should you not first ask about the person attending the camels? Your own son?

131
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,519
My son is all right when the camels are all right.

132
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,720
Then, rest assured that the camels are well, in Manjanan Valley.

133
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,839
- I did not leave until... - What keeps you here, then?

134
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,759
I fear lest someone should attempt to drive them away.

135
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,800
Who dares do that when they are well marked with your own mark?

136
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,039
Al-Khattab is not in the same position as Utbah Ibn Rabeeah,

137
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,759
the Chief of Abd Shams,

138
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,919
or Al-Waleed Ibn Al-Mugheerah, the Chief of Makhzoom, or...

139
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Do we not all belong to the Quraysh, the master tribe in Arabia and...

140
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,559
This is true when the rest of the Arabs try to rival us.

141
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,279
When we are back with our own people,

142
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,159
we are not in the same position.

143
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,359
These belong to Hashim, the others to Abd Shams,

144
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,160
those to Makhzoom and those to Jumah...

145
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Moreover, people rise in status through wealth and commerce,

146
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
If you stay away from your father's camels

147
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
and someone leads them away, then...

148
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,919
You mention wealth and trade... May I do some trading?

149
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,679
You want to do some business

150
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,879
but from where will you get your capital?

151
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,800
From my father, Al-Khattab.

152
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,200
What? Al-Khattab's money belongs to Al-Khattab until he dies,

153
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,039
which event does not seem to be imminent.

154
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,039
Besides, do you think that your father sleeps over a treasure of gold and silver?

155
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,920
You certainly speak to me as a servant, not as your own son.

156
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,639
You will not be my son if I lose some camels

157
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
while you stand here arguing with me.

158
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,159
May I not have some food first,

159
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,000
then pack some for the night I will spend in Manjanan Valley?

160
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,039
May I lose you.

161
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:12,519
When will you reach that valley, far as it is, if you rest here now?

162
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,399
Do you not realize that I have covered all this distance to Makkah today?

163
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
If you show me no kindness,

164
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,559
then at least be kind to your donkey as he deserves some rest.

165
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,120
Why did you come anyway?

166
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Did I order you to bring firewood for your aunts of the Makhzoom clan?

167
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,639
Shouldn't I be dutiful to my aunts?

168
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,879
Your dutifulness is to your father first.

169
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,640
They are not mutually exclusive.

170
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,680
I am not undutiful to my father when I show dutifulness to my aunts.

171
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,119
Then move on speedily...

172
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,519
I will sort it out for both of you, father.

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,200
Let Umar have his rest tonight in Makkah,

174
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,119
and I will go out to tend the camels

175
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,360
until he comes to meet me there on the morrow.

176
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
You will tend the camels?

177
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,160
Do you say this in praise or contempt?

178
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,839
Neither, but you do not manage what your brother manages well.

179
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,080
Nor does he manage what you do well.

180
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,279
Whoever fulfills promises will not be denounced;

181
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,199
Whoever stands on firm grounds will not stutter;

182
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,039
Whoever fears the coming of death will be overwhelmed by it,

183
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,359
even though he seeks to climb into heaven on a ladder.

184
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Whoever has plenty but refuses to help his people

185
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,399
will be disowned and denounced;

186
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,119
What brings you here at this time? Are you bringing bad news?

187
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,080
I have brought you some food.

188
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Have you covered all this distance to bring me some food?

189
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,480
I have silenced my hunger, eating my aunts' dates.

190
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,599
The truth is that I am bored with those meetings,

191
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,840
where there is nothing except talk about either our forefathers or business and trade.

192
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,360
Your position here is better;

193
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
Except for the fact that Al-Khattab works you too hard.

194
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,839
I am not complaining.

195
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,559
In the open here, life gives you clarity of thought,

196
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,960
sharper eyesight, purer feelings and unhindered nature.

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,880
As for the camels; well, when you deal with them like I did,

198
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,720
you will realize that they need proper management.

199
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,480
You will soon be able to identify them as individuals;

200
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,039
each having its own temper, manners, needs and abilities.

201
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
Each joins its herd, but no two camels are identical.

202
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
When you are fully aware of this,

203
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,760
you manage them as a herd, but you look after them as individuals.

204
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,799
You will be as kind to them as a mother to her offspring.

205
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:46,519
While this applies to camels, it is more clearly applicable to people.

206
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Their life cannot flourish unless they have leaders to manage their affairs.

207
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,400
Whoever rebels will perish.

208
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,640
A wolf only attacks a lone sheep.

209
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,559
If people stick together, each will have his own personality and intellect.

210
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,480
They will pursue their individual ways, interests and what is determined for them.

211
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,679
None can totally replace another.

212
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,559
Had it not been so, people would not need one another;

213
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
none would need what someone else has.

214
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Thus, being together is the means of maintaining their individuality,

215
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,200
and their differences bring them together.

216
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,400
You are certainly a man of wisdom, Umar, even though you are young.

217
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
Yet the elders suppress the like of you.

218
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,559
What is this?

219
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,880
Didn't you say that you would love to do some trading?

220
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,279
Go to Syria with Quraysh's trade caravan and fulfill your dream.

221
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:57,000
When you return, you can tell me about its palaces, farms,

222
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,960
and beautiful women.

223
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,720
"Damascus, 2 years before the mission of the Prophet"

224
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,920
- Umar, my friend! - Welcome to the master of Ghassan.

225
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Be careful. Should the Chief of Ghassan hear you,

226
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,559
he would complain against me to the Byzantine Emperor,

227
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,759
and I am no match to him. I am only a businessman.

228
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,119
- How are you, Umar? - I am well; and you?

229
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,080
I am well, thank God.

230
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,600
- How did you leave Makkah? - Fine

231
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,600
These, you see, are my Byzantine friends

232
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,480
and my business partners.

233
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,359
I have mentioned you to them, saying: we have tried you,

234
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,039
finding you a man of honor who does not push prices up...

235
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,039
You have already started bargaining, as you always do,

236
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,919
even before you see our merchandise.

237
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,279
You start with your praises so that you can make me recoil into submission.

238
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,279
Do you think that Umar will submit to such idle talk?

239
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
I will not ask a high price as long as you do the same.

240
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,759
I am only selling you so that I can buy your goods.

241
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:55,119
Your praise of me will be returned by similar praise.

242
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,200
Or is it that you are bargaining for these Byzantines against your brothers?

243
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,599
We are after all of the same race, speaking the same language.

244
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
Who of us deserves your kindness more?

245
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,640
We are certainly of the same race and language,

246
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,400
but I share with them religion and land.

247
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,079
Unless you wish to convert to my religion and become my brother on both counts.

248
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,080
Who knows, I may be able to introduce you to the Byzantine Emperor

249
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,720
and you gain favor with him.

250
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:20,319
Should this happen, you may prefer to stay with us,

251
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,960
and you will be most welcome.

252
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,359
Life here in Syria, a land of abundant gardens and orchards,

253
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,120
is so different from the hard life of Arabia.

254
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
Hold it. You have gone too far.

255
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,680
If you have come for business, let us do business.

256
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,720
Fair enough. What have you got for us?

257
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,559
Whatever you wish of the goods you know:

258
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,320
perfumes, incense, gums, dates, Yemeni material

259
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,120
What about the ivory from Abyssinia?

260
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,120
I do not have that, but my fellow traders do. I can get it for you.

261
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,720
- And ebony? - Likewise.

262
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,800
How about you collecting what I tell you I need,

263
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
from you and your fellows, and keep it all for me.

264
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,720
I will give you a commission, which remains between us only.

265
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,400
What is wrong? I am only serving your interest.

266
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,599
Bad indeed is the way you have chosen to benefit me.

267
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,200
You wish me to be dishonest with my friends, making a profit behind their backs.

268
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,319
In the process, I will be helping you against your own people.

269
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,639
If you monopolize the goods, you will be able to push prices up.

270
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,880
You will fix prices as you wish.

271
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,600
I speak for what is right.

272
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,200
I will not countenance that some of my friends should deal with you unfairly.

273
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,480
Injustice bears evil fruit.

274
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,039
If you hate to be treated unfairly, you hate it for others.

275
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,000
Is it your religion that teaches this?

276
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,960
I mean the idols you worship.

277
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,839
If religion does not teach me this,

278
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,279
morality, integrity and honesty require it.

279
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,919
To me, these are a religion to be followed.

280
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,880
Yet, what does your religion have to say about your action?

281
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,920
Or is money your religion,

282
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
even though you may claim to follow something else?

283
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,480
If your religion does not deter you,

284
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,079
then what about your integrity, when you are an Arab?

285
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,519
Or is it that your morality has been corrupted

286
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,599
by your long association with the Byzantines?

287
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,679
I thought that the people of Arabia and its deserts

288
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:09,960
envy us our residence in Syria, alongside Byzantium,

289
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,920
the world's superpower.

290
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,480
We are kings over the Arabs here.

291
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,279
You are kings ruling over your own people,

292
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,079
while the Byzantines are your kings.

293
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,200
Thus, you are subservient to them.

294
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,519
They use you to accomplish their goals, and in their wars,

295
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,759
but you are not allowed a part in their government.

296
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,879
How can we envy you your position?

297
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,000
When we finish our business,

298
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,839
I will take you to some Damascus districts, then to Guerguis's tavern,

299
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,600
so that you see why you should look at us with envy.

300
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,920
Go to hell with him and do not bring him here.

301
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,880
May God cut his tongue.

302
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
Why did you not give him a similar response?

303
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,680
What? He is a Byzantine soldier.

304
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,519
Indeed. I see now why we should envy you.

305
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,960
"1 year before the mission of the Prophet"

306
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,759
What? Ten Dirhams! That is too much.

307
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,639
By Al-Lat, I am only making half a dirham of profit.

308
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,559
- Take it or leave it. - We leave it, then.

309
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,200
- A bad seller you certainly are. - Safwan, Sir!

310
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,519
For only a dirham or two you turn this young lady away!

311
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,079
Sir, it is your property and your father's I am looking after.

312
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,440
I am only a servant of yours selling your goods.

313
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,119
This is the price your father fixed for me.

314
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Then give this pretty young lady the length she needs

315
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,240
for the price she is happy to pay.

316
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,039
As you wish, Sir.

317
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,919
Should there be many pretty young ladies around,

318
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
you and your father will live in poverty.

319
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,600
Should there be many, our need to spend on any one would be less.

320
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,759
Gold is so precious because of its rarity,

321
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,600
while cheap metals are plentiful.

322
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,000
O Chiefs of the Quraysh;

323
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:54,000
since when people are treated unfairly in your place

324
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,319
and their rights are taken away?

325
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,080
What is the matter, brother?

326
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,759
Chief of the Amir tribe.

327
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,399
Will you be happy when this man makes away with my right

328
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
when I am in your land?

329
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,759
No. By Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, I did nothing of the sort.

330
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,240
By the Lord of Moses, he did.

331
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,319
He bought dates and barley from me in last year's season,

332
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,960
but he had no money.

333
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,240
He asked me to lend him the price until this year

334
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,720
and he would pay me in this season the price of the goods

335
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,919
and the increase due to the delayed payment.

336
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,839
Now he denies my rightful claim.

337
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,640
When I took the dates and barley away, and he returned to Yathrib,

338
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,920
I checked the goods and discovered that he cheated me.

339
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:51,119
He placed the best dates and barley on top.

340
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,160
What was beneath it was bad and rotting, good only for animal feed.

341
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:59,359
I made a huge loss.

342
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,000
By the Lord of Moses, he lies.

343
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:04,679
When we agreed the deal, the goods were sound.

344
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,359
If what he says be true, they rotted in his keeping.

345
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,279
Why should I be blamed for his mismanagement?

346
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,679
- Abdullah! - Yes, father!

347
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,160
Pay this man from the Qurayzah what his debtor cannot pay.

348
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,919
We must not let the Jews of Yathrib say

349
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,960
that living next to the Aws and the Khazraj guarantees their rights better.

350
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,000
May God curse the one of you two who is lying.

351
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,599
Yes, by the Lord of the Kaabah.

352
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,960
May God curse the one who is lying.

353
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:40,319
By Al-Lat, were it not for Abu Zaid's honor, I would have beaten you up,

354
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,080
and I would have called on my people to turn you and the like of you out

355
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,920
You think we are easy game! Ha ha! He would beat me up!

356
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,599
When the promised one will appear,

357
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,920
we will then kill you all, just like the Aad people were destroyed.

358
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,119
What did the Jew mean when he said "the promised one"?

359
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,759
It is a Prophet who will appear among them.

360
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,039
They always say that his time is due.

361
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:13,479
Whenever they have a quarrel with Arabs, they speak of his appearance,

362
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,799
believing that with him they would be able to beat all people.

363
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,920
May this be a bad omen for them.

364
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,599
Any other challenger? Anyone dares challenge?

365
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,679
Go and bring Umar

366
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,320
Umar, you are the most knowledgeable of poetry among us.

367
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,039
Who of the poets we listened to was best?

368
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,440
Al-Khansa' has wept and made others weep.

369
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,360
She is always grieving.

370
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,119
She stops weeping only to start again.

371
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,719
Umar!

372
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,320
Here you are at last.

373
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,960
Show him what Quraysh's pride can do.

374
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,760
He is no match to you. Come on, Umar. Come one, Umar; he is yours

375
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,480
Good work; good, Umar

376
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Hit him, Umar, hit him!

377
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:00,119
This is Quraysh's man, hero, ambassador

378
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,319
and spokesman when it has a dispute.

379
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Whoever thinks that he has a lead over us,

380
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,880
let him come forward, or stay away.

381
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,639
This man has stressed what God has granted to the Quraysh.

382
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,119
My Lord, the Lord of Abraham.

383
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,919
This is Your house which You have consecrated.

384
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,839
Purge it of all filth

385
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
and all that those people have perpetrated in it.

386
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,039
In the Name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful:

387
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,119
"Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists)"

388
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,880
"He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood)"

389
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,079
"Read! And your Lord is the most Generous"

390
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,119
"Who has taught (the writing) by the pen"

391
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,680
"He has taught man that which he knew not"

392
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,120
Good evening, uncle, Waraqah Ibn Nawfal

393
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,119
- Aren't you Abu Talib's son? - Ali.

394
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
By God, there must be something serious that brings you here at this time.

395
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,759
Has Khadijah mentioned why she is calling me at this time?

396
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,360
No

397
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,640
God be glorified. If you are telling me the truth, my nephew,

398
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,599
then this is the same angel sent to Moses.

399
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:31,639
I wish I will be alive when your people drive you out...

400
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,840
Everyone who came up with a similar message

401
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,360
was met with hostility...

402
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:47,079
If I am alive on that day, I will give unwavering support.

403
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,880
My nephew! Make sure to stick to your cousin.

404
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,320
His message is the truth coming from the Lord of the heavens and earth.

405
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,800
What may be in store for this city of ours?

406
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,000
In the Name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful:

407
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,719
"O you, enveloped in garments!"

408
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,680
"Arise and warn!"

409
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,719
"And Magnify your Lord (Allah)!"

410
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,759
"And purify your garments!"

411
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,960
"And keep away from Al-Rujz (the idols)!"

412
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,720
"And give not a thing in order to have more"
