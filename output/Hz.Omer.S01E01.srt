1
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,319
I respond to You, my Lord.

2
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
I respond to You as You have no partner.

3
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,719
All praise is due to You;

4
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,880
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

5
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,480
You have no partner.

6
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,680
I respond to You, my Lord.

7
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,719
I respond to You as You have no partner.

8
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
All praise is due to You;

9
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,520
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

10
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,799
You have no partner.

11
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,560
I respond to You, my Lord.

12
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,439
I respond to You as You have no partner.

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,840
All praise is due to You;

14
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,319
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

15
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,719
You have no partner.

16
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,920
I respond to You, my Lord.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,639
I respond to You as You have no partner.

18
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,199
All praise is due to You;

19
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,360
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

20
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,800
You have no partner.

21
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,960
I respond to You, my Lord.

22
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,759
I respond to You as You have no partner.

23
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,240
All praise is due to You;

24
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,319
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,280
You have no partner.

26
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,160
I respond to You, my Lord.

27
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,200
I respond to You as You have no partner.

28
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
All praise is due to You;

29
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,039
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

30
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,560
You have no partner.

31
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,719
I respond to You, my Lord.

32
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,760
I respond to You as You have no partner.

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
All praise is due to You;

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
all grace comes from You; all dominion is Yours.

35
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,919
You have no partner.

36
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,199
My Lord, give me neither too much nor too little of the riches of this world,

37
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,159
so that I may neither overstep my limits nor forget my responsibilities.

38
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,120
A small but sufficient amount is better than what is plentiful but causes distraction.

39
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:46,039
My Lord, I have advanced in age, and lost much of my strength,

40
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,639
while my subjects have increased.

41
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,920
Gather me to You while I am able to fulfill my responsibilities, abandoning none.

42
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,799
A ruler's most important duty towards his people

43
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,800
is to give priority to their duties towards God,

44
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,879
as outlined in their religion representing His guidance.

45
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,480
It is our task to bid you to fulfill what God has commanded you

46
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,079
as His obedient servants,

47
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,639
and to refrain from sinful disobedience to Him.

48
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,759
We also have to implement God's commandments

49
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:32,560
as they apply equally to all people, in complete fulfillment of justice.

50
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,080
In so doing, we provide a chance for the ignorant to learn,

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,840
the careless to take heed and the one seeking lead to follow suit...

52
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,560
To be a true believer is not achieved by wishful thinking,

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,759
but by clear action.

54
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,000
The more diligent people are, the greater is their reward from God.

55
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,040
Jihad is the topmost duty of all.

56
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,360
The people who are truly engaged in jihad are those who abandon sinful practices

57
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,519
and whoever indulges in them.

58
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,439
Some people claim to have participated in jihad,

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,480
but true jihad for God's cause is to steer away from sin,

60
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,719
Nothing is dearer to God Almighty and of greater benefit to mankind

61
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
than a ruler's kindness based on true knowledge and insight.

62
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,360
Nothing is more hateful to God than a ruler's ignorance and stupidity.

63
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,920
By God, I do not appoint governors and officials in your provinces

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,639
so that they will beat you up or take away your money.

65
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,639
I send them to you to instruct you in your faith

66
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,000
and teach you the way the Prophet has shown us.

67
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
Whoever is treated differently should put their complaints to me.

68
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,640
By God who holds my soul in His hand, I will ensure that justice is done to them.

69
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,160
If I fail to do so, I become a partner in such injustice.

70
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,120
It is much better for me to remove a governor every day

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,399
than to leave a despot in his position for an hour longer.

72
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,759
To replace governors is much easier than to change the people.

73
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,719
If setting things right for a community requires

74
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,639
replacing their governor, then it is certainly easy.

75
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,200
Therefore, whoever is in a position of authority in any area of people's affairs

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,439
must fear God in the way he treats his people.

77
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
To all these I say, do not beat people up to humiliate them.

78
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,199
Do not deny them their rights, showing them little care,

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,160
and do not place them in hardship making them feel lost.

80
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
My people, when you have completed your pilgrimage rituals,

81
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,759
let the people of different regions meet me together with their governors and officials

82
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,359
so that I can look into their situations.

83
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,039
I will consider their disputes and give my judgment,

84
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,320
making sure that the weak are given their rights and justice is done to all.

85
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,759
Would you like to stop here for rest, Sir?

86
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,399
What makes you tearful, Sir?

87
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,639
My feeling of gratitude to God for His boundless grace,

88
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,399
and my fear of being tested with it.

89
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
There is no deity other than God Almighty,

90
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,080
who grants whatever He pleases to whomever He wills.

91
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,519
I can look at myself tending Al-Khattab's camels in this valley,

92
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:44,919
He was a rough, hard man, working me to exhaustion

93
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
and beating me up if I slackened.

94
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
Now...

95
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,760
I am in my position with no one to stand between me and God.

96
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,120
"6 years before the mission of the Prophet"

97
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,839
May we water our animals at your well, young man?

98
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,319
Who are you, people?

99
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,079
We belong to the tribe of Khuzaah

100
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
What if I refuse?

101
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
Then we will go back in peace,

102
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,679
hoping to find what we want with some noble person.

103
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,560
A noble man gives for a gentle approach what he denies for a rough one.

104
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,000
When we have finished and begun to move our camels away,

105
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,639
you may bring in your camels. You are most welcome.

106
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
May I know the name of the generous young man?

107
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,240
Umar... Umar Ibn Al-Khattab

108
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,760
Of which clan of Quraysh?

109
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,399
And you know that I belong to the Quraysh?

110
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,720
The Qurayshi looks cannot be mistaken.

111
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,639
- I belong to the clan of Adiyy. - Kind and noble people.

112
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,240
Umar!

113
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Here is the firewood you need, aunt. Shall I bring it in?

114
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,120
Leave it here for now.

115
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,879
Won't you come in and have something to eat?

116
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,080
No, I won't eat until I have delivered the rest of the firewood to my other aunts.

117
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,839
I must not be late returning to Al-Khattab's camels.

118
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,919
Otherwise, he will be angry.

119
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,879
If you like, we would speak to him to reduce your work.

120
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,560
I do not wish for lighter work, but for a strong body.

121
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,679
This you have been given.

122
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,639
May God give you increased strength, you son of Hantamah.

123
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
Wait a moment, Umar.

124
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
This is for you: dates from Yathrib and raisins from Taif.

125
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
What brings you home at this time?

126
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,360
What about the camels...

127
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,880
I gathered some firewood for my maternal aunts...

128
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,519
What about the camels?

129
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,679
Your camels are all right

130
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,879
Should you not first ask about the person attending the camels? Your own son?

131
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,519
My son is all right when the camels are all right.

132
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,720
Then, rest assured that the camels are well, in Manjanan Valley.

133
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,839
- I did not leave until... - What keeps you here, then?

134
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,759
I fear lest someone should attempt to drive them away.

135
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,800
Who dares do that when they are well marked with your own mark?

136
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,039
Al-Khattab is not in the same position as Utbah Ibn Rabeeah,

137
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,759
the Chief of Abd Shams,

138
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,919
or Al-Waleed Ibn Al-Mugheerah, the Chief of Makhzoom, or...

139
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Do we not all belong to the Quraysh, the master tribe in Arabia and...

140
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,559
This is true when the rest of the Arabs try to rival us.

141
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,279
When we are back with our own people,

142
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,159
we are not in the same position.

143
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,359
These belong to Hashim, the others to Abd Shams,

144
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,160
those to Makhzoom and those to Jumah...

145
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,480
Moreover, people rise in status through wealth and commerce,

146
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
If you stay away from your father's camels

147
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
and someone leads them away, then...

148
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,919
You mention wealth and trade... May I do some trading?

149
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,679
You want to do some business

150
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,879
but from where will you get your capital?

151
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,800
From my father, Al-Khattab.

152
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,200
What? Al-Khattab's money belongs to Al-Khattab until he dies,

153
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,039
which event does not seem to be imminent.

154
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,039
Besides, do you think that your father sleeps over a treasure of gold and silver?

155
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,920
You certainly speak to me as a servant, not as your own son.

156
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,639
You will not be my son if I lose some camels

157
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,840
while you stand here arguing with me.

158
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,159
May I not have some food first,

159
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,000
then pack some for the night I will spend in Manjanan Valley?

160
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,039
May I lose you.

161
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:58,519
When will you reach that valley, far as it is, if you rest here now?

162
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:03,399
Do you not realize that I have covered all this distance to Makkah today?

163
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
If you show me no kindness,

164
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,559
then at least be kind to your donkey as he deserves some rest.

165
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,120
Why did you come anyway?

166
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Did I order you to bring firewood for your aunts of the Makhzoom clan?

167
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,639
Shouldn't I be dutiful to my aunts?

168
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,879
Your dutifulness is to your father first.

169
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,640
They are not mutually exclusive.

170
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,680
I am not undutiful to my father when I show dutifulness to my aunts.

171
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,119
Then move on speedily...

172
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,519
I will sort it out for both of you, father.

173
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,200
Let Umar have his rest tonight in Makkah,

174
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,119
and I will go out to tend the camels

175
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,360
until he comes to meet me there on the morrow.

176
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
You will tend the camels?

177
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
Do you say this in praise or contempt?

178
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,839
Neither, but you do not manage what your brother manages well.

179
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,080
Nor does he manage what you do well.

180
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,279
Whoever fulfills promises will not be denounced;

181
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,199
Whoever stands on firm grounds will not stutter;

182
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,039
Whoever fears the coming of death will be overwhelmed by it,

183
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,359
even though he seeks to climb into heaven on a ladder.

184
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Whoever has plenty but refuses to help his people

185
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,399
will be disowned and denounced;

186
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,119
What brings you here at this time? Are you bringing bad news?

187
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,080
I have brought you some food.

188
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Have you covered all this distance to bring me some food?

189
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,480
I have silenced my hunger, eating my aunts' dates.

190
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,599
The truth is that I am bored with those meetings,

191
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,840
where there is nothing except talk about either our forefathers or business and trade.

192
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,360
Your position here is better;

193
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,440
Except for the fact that Al-Khattab works you too hard.

194
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,839
I am not complaining.

195
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,559
In the open here, life gives you clarity of thought,

196
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,960
sharper eyesight, purer feelings and unhindered nature.

197
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,880
As for the camels; well, when you deal with them like I did,

198
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,720
you will realize that they need proper management.

199
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,480
You will soon be able to identify them as individuals;

200
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,039
each having its own temper, manners, needs and abilities.

201
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,600
Each joins its herd, but no two camels are identical.

202
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,799
When you are fully aware of this,

203
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,760
you manage them as a herd, but you look after them as individuals.

204
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,799
You will be as kind to them as a mother to her offspring.

205
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,519
While this applies to camels, it is more clearly applicable to people.

206
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,920
Their life cannot flourish unless they have leaders to manage their affairs.

207
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
Whoever rebels will perish.

208
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,640
A wolf only attacks a lone sheep.

209
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,559
If people stick together, each will have his own personality and intellect.

210
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,480
They will pursue their individual ways, interests and what is determined for them.

211
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,679
None can totally replace another.

212
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,559
Had it not been so, people would not need one another;

213
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,120
none would need what someone else has.

214
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,600
Thus, being together is the means of maintaining their individuality,

215
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,200
and their differences bring them together.

216
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,400
You are certainly a man of wisdom, Umar, even though you are young.

217
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
Yet the elders suppress the like of you.

218
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,559
What is this?

219
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,880
Didn't you say that you would love to do some trading?

220
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,279
Go to Syria with Quraysh's trade caravan and fulfill your dream.

221
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:43,000
When you return, you can tell me about its palaces, farms,

222
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,960
and beautiful women.

223
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,720
"Damascus, 2 years before the mission of the Prophet"

224
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,920
- Umar, my friend! - Welcome to the master of Ghassan.

225
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,640
Be careful. Should the Chief of Ghassan hear you,

226
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,559
he would complain against me to the Byzantine Emperor,

227
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,759
and I am no match to him. I am only a businessman.

228
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:00,119
- How are you, Umar? - I am well; and you?

229
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,080
I am well, thank God.

230
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,600
- How did you leave Makkah? - Fine

231
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,600
These, you see, are my Byzantine friends

232
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,480
and my business partners.

233
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,359
I have mentioned you to them, saying: we have tried you,

234
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,039
finding you a man of honor who does not push prices up...

235
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,039
You have already started bargaining, as you always do,

236
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,919
even before you see our merchandise.

237
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,279
You start with your praises so that you can make me recoil into submission.

238
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,279
Do you think that Umar will submit to such idle talk?

239
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,640
I will not ask a high price as long as you do the same.

240
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,759
I am only selling you so that I can buy your goods.

241
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,119
Your praise of me will be returned by similar praise.

242
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,200
Or is it that you are bargaining for these Byzantines against your brothers?

243
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,599
We are after all of the same race, speaking the same language.

244
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
Who of us deserves your kindness more?

245
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,640
We are certainly of the same race and language,

246
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,400
but I share with them religion and land.

247
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,079
Unless you wish to convert to my religion and become my brother on both counts.

248
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,080
Who knows, I may be able to introduce you to the Byzantine Emperor

249
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,720
and you gain favor with him.

250
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,319
Should this happen, you may prefer to stay with us,

251
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,960
and you will be most welcome.

252
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,359
Life here in Syria, a land of abundant gardens and orchards,

253
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
is so different from the hard life of Arabia.

254
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
Hold it. You have gone too far.

255
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,680
If you have come for business, let us do business.

256
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,720
Fair enough. What have you got for us?

257
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
Whatever you wish of the goods you know:

258
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,320
perfumes, incense, gums, dates, Yemeni material

259
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,120
What about the ivory from Abyssinia?

260
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,120
I do not have that, but my fellow traders do. I can get it for you.

261
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,720
- And ebony? - Likewise.

262
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,800
How about you collecting what I tell you I need,

263
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
from you and your fellows, and keep it all for me.

264
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,720
I will give you a commission, which remains between us only.

265
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,400
What is wrong? I am only serving your interest.

266
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,599
Bad indeed is the way you have chosen to benefit me.

267
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,200
You wish me to be dishonest with my friends, making a profit behind their backs.

268
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,319
In the process, I will be helping you against your own people.

269
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,639
If you monopolize the goods, you will be able to push prices up.

270
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,880
You will fix prices as you wish.

271
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,600
I speak for what is right.

272
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,200
I will not countenance that some of my friends should deal with you unfairly.

273
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,480
Injustice bears evil fruit.

274
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,039
If you hate to be treated unfairly, you hate it for others.

275
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,000
Is it your religion that teaches this?

276
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,960
I mean the idols you worship.

277
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,839
If religion does not teach me this,

278
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,279
morality, integrity and honesty require it.

279
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,919
To me, these are a religion to be followed.

280
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,880
Yet, what does your religion have to say about your action?

281
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,920
Or is money your religion,

282
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
even though you may claim to follow something else?

283
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,480
If your religion does not deter you,

284
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,079
then what about your integrity, when you are an Arab?

285
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,519
Or is it that your morality has been corrupted

286
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,599
by your long association with the Byzantines?

287
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,679
I thought that the people of Arabia and its deserts

288
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,960
envy us our residence in Syria, alongside Byzantium,

289
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,920
the world's superpower.

290
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
We are kings over the Arabs here.

291
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,279
You are kings ruling over your own people,

292
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,079
while the Byzantines are your kings.

293
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Thus, you are subservient to them.

294
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,519
They use you to accomplish their goals, and in their wars,

295
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,759
but you are not allowed a part in their government.

296
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,879
How can we envy you your position?

297
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,000
When we finish our business,

298
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,839
I will take you to some Damascus districts, then to Guerguis's tavern,

299
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,600
so that you see why you should look at us with envy.

300
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,920
Go to hell with him and do not bring him here.

301
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,880
May God cut his tongue.

302
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,120
Why did you not give him a similar response?

303
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,680
What? He is a Byzantine soldier.

304
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,519
Indeed. I see now why we should envy you.

305
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,960
"1 year before the mission of the Prophet"

306
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,759
What? Ten Dirhams! That is too much.

307
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,639
By Al-Lat, I am only making half a dirham of profit.

308
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,559
- Take it or leave it. - We leave it, then.

309
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,200
- A bad seller you certainly are. - Safwan, Sir!

310
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,519
For only a dirham or two you turn this young lady away!

311
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,079
Sir, it is your property and your father's I am looking after.

312
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,440
I am only a servant of yours selling your goods.

313
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:01,119
This is the price your father fixed for me.

314
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Then give this pretty young lady the length she needs

315
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,240
for the price she is happy to pay.

316
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,039
As you wish, Sir.

317
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,919
Should there be many pretty young ladies around,

318
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
you and your father will live in poverty.

319
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,600
Should there be many, our need to spend on any one would be less.

320
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,759
Gold is so precious because of its rarity,

321
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,600
while cheap metals are plentiful.

322
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,000
O Chiefs of the Quraysh;

323
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,000
since when people are treated unfairly in your place

324
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,319
and their rights are taken away?

325
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,080
What is the matter, brother?

326
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,759
Chief of the Amir tribe.

327
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,399
Will you be happy when this man makes away with my right

328
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,640
when I am in your land?

329
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,759
No. By Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, I did nothing of the sort.

330
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,240
By the Lord of Moses, he did.

331
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,319
He bought dates and barley from me in last year's season,

332
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,960
but he had no money.

333
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,240
He asked me to lend him the price until this year

334
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:15,720
and he would pay me in this season the price of the goods

335
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,919
and the increase due to the delayed payment.

336
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,839
Now he denies my rightful claim.

337
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,640
When I took the dates and barley away, and he returned to Yathrib,

338
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,920
I checked the goods and discovered that he cheated me.

339
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,119
He placed the best dates and barley on top.

340
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,160
What was beneath it was bad and rotting, good only for animal feed.

341
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:45,359
I made a huge loss.

342
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,000
By the Lord of Moses, he lies.

343
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,679
When we agreed the deal, the goods were sound.

344
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,359
If what he says be true, they rotted in his keeping.

345
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,279
Why should I be blamed for his mismanagement?

346
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,679
- Abdullah! - Yes, father!

347
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,160
Pay this man from the Qurayzah what his debtor cannot pay.

348
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,919
We must not let the Jews of Yathrib say

349
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,960
that living next to the Aws and the Khazraj guarantees their rights better.

350
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,000
May God curse the one of you two who is lying.

351
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,599
Yes, by the Lord of the Kaabah.

352
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,960
May God curse the one who is lying.

353
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,319
By Al-Lat, were it not for Abu Zaid's honor, I would have beaten you up,

354
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,080
and I would have called on my people to turn you and the like of you out

355
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,920
You think we are easy game! Ha ha! He would beat me up!

356
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,599
When the promised one will appear,

357
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,920
we will then kill you all, just like the Aad people were destroyed.

358
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,119
What did the Jew mean when he said "the promised one"?

359
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,759
It is a Prophet who will appear among them.

360
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,039
They always say that his time is due.

361
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,479
Whenever they have a quarrel with Arabs, they speak of his appearance,

362
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,799
believing that with him they would be able to beat all people.

363
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,920
May this be a bad omen for them.

364
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,599
Any other challenger? Anyone dares challenge?

365
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,679
Go and bring Umar

366
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,320
Umar, you are the most knowledgeable of poetry among us.

367
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,039
Who of the poets we listened to was best?

368
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,440
Al-Khansa' has wept and made others weep.

369
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,360
She is always grieving.

370
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,119
She stops weeping only to start again.

371
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,719
Umar!

372
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
Here you are at last.

373
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,960
Show him what Quraysh's pride can do.

374
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,760
He is no match to you. Come on, Umar. Come one, Umar; he is yours

375
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
Good work; good, Umar

376
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
Hit him, Umar, hit him!

377
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,119
This is Quraysh's man, hero, ambassador

378
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,319
and spokesman when it has a dispute.

379
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Whoever thinks that he has a lead over us,

380
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,880
let him come forward, or stay away.

381
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,639
This man has stressed what God has granted to the Quraysh.

382
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,119
My Lord, the Lord of Abraham.

383
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,919
This is Your house which You have consecrated.

384
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,839
Purge it of all filth

385
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
and all that those people have perpetrated in it.

386
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,039
In the Name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful:

387
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,119
"Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists)"

388
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,880
"He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood)"

389
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,079
"Read! And your Lord is the most Generous"

390
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
"Who has taught (the writing) by the pen"

391
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,680
"He has taught man that which he knew not"

392
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,120
Good evening, uncle, Waraqah Ibn Nawfal

393
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:06,119
- Aren't you Abu Talib's son? - Ali.

394
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,440
By God, there must be something serious that brings you here at this time.

395
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,759
Has Khadijah mentioned why she is calling me at this time?

396
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,360
No

397
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,640
God be glorified. If you are telling me the truth, my nephew,

398
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,599
then this is the same angel sent to Moses.

399
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:17,639
I wish I will be alive when your people drive you out...

400
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,840
Everyone who came up with a similar message

401
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,360
was met with hostility...

402
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:33,079
If I am alive on that day, I will give unwavering support.

403
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,880
My nephew! Make sure to stick to your cousin.

404
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,320
His message is the truth coming from the Lord of the heavens and earth.

405
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
What may be in store for this city of ours?

406
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,000
In the Name of God, most Gracious, most Merciful:

407
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,719
"O you, enveloped in garments!"

408
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,680
"Arise and warn!"

409
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:33,719
"And Magnify your Lord (Allah)!"

410
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,759
"And purify your garments!"

411
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,960
"And keep away from Al-Rujz (the idols)!"

412
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,720
"And give not a thing in order to have more"
