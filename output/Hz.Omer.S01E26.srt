00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,460
Farouk Omar
(Omar Ibn Al-Khattab)

2
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,350
Episode 26.

3
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,934
You are very tired, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

4
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:18,940
Wouldn't you rather go back
and have some sleep?

5
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:23,392
No. I will just rest here a little.

6
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:31,375
Daughter, get up
and add some water to the milk.

7
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:34,580
In the morning you need
to go out and sell it.

8
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,350
God forbids, mother.

9
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:41,109
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen sent a crier making
clear that milk must not be mixed with water.

10
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,491
You cannot be seen here
by Umar or his crier.

11
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,552
Get up and do as I told you.

12
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:50,095
I would not obey him in public
and disobey him in private.

13
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:52,940
A small income with obedience to God
is better than plenty with a sin.

14
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:57,472
If Umar cannot see us,
God who never sleeps sees us.

15
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:06,062
Know the place, Aslam.

16
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:12,588
Tomorrow, find out who said what to who,
and whether they are married or not.

17
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:49,969
- Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!
- May we come in?

18
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,205
What is the matter, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?
I hope it is something good.

19
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:11,175
Bring in your daughter please.

20
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,852
I went out on night watch last night,
then I felt tired.

21
00:05:53,162 --> 00:05:55,592
I reclined against your wall

22
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:59,058
and God made me hear your conversation
concerning that milk you have.

23
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:02,138
I repent, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

24
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:05,042
God forgives sins and accepts repentance.

25
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,569
Indeed, but He is also stern in punishment.

26
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,088
So fear God and never do it again.

27
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,009
I will not. Certainly not.

28
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:17,632
As for you, how good you are.

29
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,006
I enquired about you and learnt that
the young woman is unmarried.

30
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,468
- Would you like to marry...
- Zainab. She is Zainab.

31
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:31,857
This is my son, Asim,
and he is unmarried.

32
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,859
I spoke to him about you
and encouraged him. He is willing.

33
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:41,138
Would you like to look at him
and let him look at you?

34
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:45,588
If you both like what you see,
we will marry you.

35
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:08,656
She must look at him first.

36
00:07:24,865 --> 00:07:27,986
Do you accept him as husband?

37
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,732
Why wouldn't she accept
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen's son?

38
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:37,967
You are the guardian of both of them.
Silence is the sign of acceptance.

39
00:07:38,284 --> 00:07:41,357
Do not be taken in by his being
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen's son.

40
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,155
He has no money of his own.

41
00:07:43,471 --> 00:07:46,721
If he treats you badly,
I will give him double punishment.

42
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:54,279
May God unite you two well
and give you good children.

43
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:32,566
You are not so shy and silnt in Istakhr
when I tried a bit of flirtation.

44
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,887
Had I known that you were
the Emperor, the king of kings.

45
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:42,221
I myself did not not know.
My mother had told me that

46
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,632
I am the grandson of the great emperor,
Khosrau Parvez,

47
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,552
and that she hid me so that my uncle
Shirweih could not lay his hands on me

48
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,068
and kill me as he killed his father, brothers

49
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,618
and all male descendents of his father.

50
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:59,615
She kept telling me not to let anyone
know this truth.

51
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,590
She told me that I must remain
an ordinary person.

52
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:04,865
Then you know what happened.

53
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:12,661
Now we are here in the white palace
which belonged to my forefathers.

54
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:17,172
How do you feel, your majesty, now
that you have regained your heritage?

55
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,133
I don't know.

56
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,931
I mean... sometimes I feel a stranger.

57
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:30,545
I have been used to ordinary life.
I look around me

58
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:35,304
and see princes, commanders, nobility
and servants prostrating themselves to me.

59
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:38,495
I have the treasures of my forefathers.

60
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:42,700
I only have to give a signal
for someone to be killed,

61
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:47,922
or to fall from luxury to misery,
or to rise from misery to luxury.

62
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,812
This makes me feel that
I am bigger than life, greater than death,

63
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:56,734
and that a light of the Great Spirit
is now inside me.

64
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,767
It is what brought me to the throne
of my forefathers

65
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:03,466
and to the White Palace.
Why wouldn't all this please me?

66
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:11,917
I do know now why princes have fought
each other for the throne, killing one another.

67
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,704
Enter please.

68
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:24,704
Peace be to you, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
- And to you two be peace.

69
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,623
Sit down, both of you.

70
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:31,566
My Lord, help me against them both.

71
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:34,703
Each one of them wants me
to slip in his favor.

72
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:40,345
Fear God concerning your dispute.

73
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:44,120
We only judge in accordance with
what appears to us to be right.

74
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,292
We have no knowledge
of what is in people's hearts.

75
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:54,276
Remember what the Prophet said:
"You come to me with your disputes.

76
00:10:54,557 --> 00:11:03,541
Some of you may have a better argument,
and I may judge for him according to what I hear.

77
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,360
If I give a person something
that rightfully belongs to his brother,

78
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:12,206
he should not take it.
I am only giving him a brand of fire."

79
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:17,669
Present your complaint, Dahhak,
before your opponent.

80
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,450
I have at Al-Urayyid a spring of water.

81
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:25,279
In between the spring and my farm

82
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:28,110
lies a plot of land belonging
to Muhammad Ibn Maslamah.

83
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:34,340
If I want to run the water to my land,
it must go through Muhammad's land,

84
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,289
but he denied me that.

85
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:42,315
I said to him, "It is a benefit for you:
You can have your drinking water

86
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:46,659
and irrigate your land if you wish.
It will not be of any disadvantage to you."

87
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,584
But he still refuses.

88
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,469
Why do you deny your brother
something that benefits him

89
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:55,423
when it is of benefit to you too?
You can use it without any disadvantage.

90
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:59,807
It is my land, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,

91
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:04,377
I am free to do whatever I like with it,
permitting anything or refusing it.

92
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:09,283
I fear that if I let this go that he
and his family take advantage of that,

93
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:15,409
enter it and spoil my things there.
It is as if I leave it to any passerby.

94
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:26,502
That it is your property is acknowledged.

95
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,458
However, your refusal harms him.

96
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:33,879
It is as if you are preventing him
to benefit by his land.

97
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:36,669
This does not brings you any benefit,

98
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,444
while letting the water through
will benefit both of you,

99
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:44,488
without giving you any disadvantage.
Do you give priority to harm over benefit?

100
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:49,739
We are only in charge
of what God has given us.

101
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:54,934
We should use it for benefit
to ourselves and others.

102
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:57,879
The purpose is to build the earth.

103
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:05,051
You may stipulate that he must not harm
your land. If he does, I will punish him.

104
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:09,521
Won't you let me have a choice in my
own land, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

105
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:11,443
There is no choice in this matter.

106
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,679
He shall have his water running
despite your objections. This is final.

107
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:19,754
- Peace be to you.
- And to you be peace.

108
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,001
Enter!

109
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,380
- Is is a complaint?
- Yes, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

110
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,224
- Against Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah?
- Against these servants of his.

111
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:35,036
They work for me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

112
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,628
- What have they done?
- They stole my she-camel.

113
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,199
- Did you?
- We did, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

114
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:49,357
Then we will implement the punishment
for theft against you.

115
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,900
Tell me first, what have you done
with his she-camel?

116
00:13:56,914 --> 00:14:01,053
We slaughtered it,
ate of it and fed other people.

117
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:05,037
Why did you do that?

118
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,865
Speak out. Do not worry about him.

119
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,712
Because of hunger, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
It has bitten hard at us.

120
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,920
Don't you give your servants
enough to eat, Hatib?

121
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:26,538
All power operates by God's will.
Where has compassion gone?

122
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:30,607
You employ them and leave them hungry?

123
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:34,892
Even if any of them eats what God
has forbidden, he will incur no sin,

124
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:39,365
as God says: "He who is driven by
necessity, not intending to transgress

125
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:44,956
nor exceeding his need, incurs no sin.
God is Much-Forgiving, Merciful."
(Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 173)

126
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:48,662
I am sparing them the mandatory
punishment because of suspected necessity.

127
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:51,434
In case of doubt, it is better
to suspend mandatory punishments

128
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:55,225
than to implement them.
All three of you leave now.

129
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,318
What about my she-camel,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

130
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,628
By God, as I have spared
them the punishment,

131
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:06,338
I shall fine you heavily. You are
the one who caused this offence.

132
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,867
How much were you offered
for your she-camel?

133
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:13,227
- Four hundred dirhams.
- Go and give him eight hundred.

134
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,910
- Am I to give him double its price?
- Yes, you will.

135
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:20,230
I shall be enquiring about your servants.
If I hear that you have kept them hungry,

136
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:23,921
causing them to incur a mandatory
punishment, you will suffer that punishment.

137
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,707
The case is settled.

138
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:45,795
- Peace be to Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
- And to you be peace with God's mercy.

139
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,448
- I am seeking your advice.
- Speak!

140
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:58,204
I have a daughter. In pre-Islamic days
I took her out aiming to bury her alive.

141
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:05,577
When I put her under the dust,
I was overwhelmed with compassion

142
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:10,815
and I took her out.
Then we embraced Islam.

143
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:18,909
When she was a young woman,
she incurred a grave sin.

144
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,781
You mean adultery?

145
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:32,933
She took a blade to commit suicide.

146
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:37,188
We saved her after she had cut
some of her veins.

147
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:40,921
I had treated her
until she regained her health.

148
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:47,656
Subsequently she truly repented
and she is of good character.

149
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:52,522
She is thus one of those whose bad
actions God changes into good ones.

150
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:59,861
Now someone wants to marry her.
Should I inform him of what happened?

151
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:03,720
Would you expose something
God wants to remain hidden?

152
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,452
If you tell anyone of what she did,

153
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,904
I will make of you an example
to all people in all provinces.

154
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:15,312
Give her in marriage
as a chaste Muslim woman.

155
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:23,310
You have removed my burden,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

156
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:28,120
May God remove all worry from you
in this life and in the hereafter.

157
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,884
Do not do that.
It will be a negative point for you,

158
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:34,993
and an act of pride on my part,
which God dislikes.

159
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,565
I am only one of the Muslim community,

160
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:41,967
but my test is harder than yours
because of my position.

161
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,724
Go to your business, may God bless you.

162
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:35,591
My Lord, I have tried my best
to arrive at the right rulings

163
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:38,013
on questions to which nothing
in the Qur'an or the Sunnah

164
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,005
of the Prophet appeared applicable.

165
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,761
My aim is to set things to right, as far
as far as I can.

166
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:53,310
This is my understanding of Your Faith.
If I am right,

167
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,001
It is because of Your guidance,

168
00:18:57,251 --> 00:19:00,611
and if I am wrong, it is because
of my own faulty understanding.

169
00:19:00,923 --> 00:19:03,531
In You I place my trust, and to You I turn.

170
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:20,639
Abu Al-Hasan, I have been having
too many cases of complaints to look into.

171
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,975
I would love that you will
share these with me,

172
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,906
so that you judge in disputes as I do.

173
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:32,833
You are the depository of knowledge
of Islam and a guide to the Truth.

174
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:37,812
Suppose that I give a ruling
on a certain case,

175
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,582
and you hear of my ruling
but disagree with it. What will you do?

176
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:49,141
Where there is a clear statement
in God's Book or the Prophet's sunnah,

177
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,733
we can have no dispute.

178
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:54,034
You know them better than anyone else.

179
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,784
On cases left to personal discretion,
we are equal.

180
00:19:58,033 --> 00:20:00,407
Everyone judges as he sees right.

181
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:04,053
I will not abrogate a ruling given by Abu
Al-Hassan on the basis of his discretion,

182
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:08,297
even though I may have a different view.
We pray for God's guidance.

183
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:12,379
Then I will do, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

184
00:20:13,751 --> 00:20:18,019
May God always keep me
where Abu Al-Hasan is.

185
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,197
We are witnessing events

186
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,649
with no parallel that happened
during the Prophet's lifetime.

187
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:34,527
We do not find in God's Book
rulings applicable to them.

188
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,612
We judge them as we see fit,

189
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,785
according to our understanding
of the objectives of our religion

190
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:43,506
and the interests of the people.

191
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:47,432
Personal judgement
by the Prophet was right,

192
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:52,224
because God showed him,
but revelation has ceased.

193
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:57,063
When we judge on the basis
of personal discretion,

194
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:02,818
no one may say that his own judgement
is God's judgement.

195
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,794
Anyone who says so claims to be
privy to God's own knowledge

196
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:08,047
and purposes while others are not.

197
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:12,646
If you disagree with him you will be as
if you disagree with God.

198
00:21:12,894 --> 00:21:16,331
Soon enough,
he will brand you as disbeliever.

199
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,613
He may even consider
that you deserve to be killed.

200
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:22,861
That is certainly a disastrous
state of affairs.

201
00:21:24,472 --> 00:21:27,805
Discretion is available to all.

202
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,088
People may have different views
on the same question.

203
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:34,893
Besides, one may have
a certain view today,

204
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:41,136
but then discovers that a different view
is better, so he abandons his first one.

205
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:46,273
I ruled on a particular question
according to my discretion,

206
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:51,628
and then I heard someone saying:
'This is God's ruling and Umar's ruling'.

207
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:55,618
I was about to punish him severely.
It was a bad utterance.

208
00:21:57,677 --> 00:22:04,109
That was Umar's judgement. If it
is right, then that is by God's grace,

209
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:09,070
and if it is wrong,
then it is Umar's mistake.

210
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:19,253
O people! O people!
Follow the Sunnah!

211
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:23,456
Follow the course which is defined
by God and His Messenger.

212
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,395
What is determined on the basis of personal
Discretion must not be considered...

213
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,628
in the same status.

214
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:44,755
- Peace be to you with God's mercy.
- And to you be peace with God's mercy.

215
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,926
You must be meeting for something
special. Let us hope it is good.

216
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:52,628
I received news that the Bishop
of the city had a son

217
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:58,152
and he is hosting a celebration tonight,
giving people much to eat and drink.

218
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,601
And are we to celebrate with him?

219
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:03,520
Yes, in our own way.

220
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,186
I also learnt that he will send much food
and drink to the city guards.

221
00:23:08,497 --> 00:23:13,115
When these drink, they are excessive
and they get drunk or nearly so.

222
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,194
This gives us an opportunity
we must not miss.

223
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,900
- You mean...
- Yes, it seems it is time.

224
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:22,302
Deep into the night,
they will be much less alert,

225
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:26,742
due to their drunkenness and sleepiness.
We can climb the wall then.

226
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:31,023
At the Eastern Gate?
But it is the most difficult.

227
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:34,381
Yes, but it is the least guarded,
as our scouts have confirmed.

228
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:37,948
They rely on the strength of the gate
and the thickness of the wall next to it.

229
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,294
The Muslims! The Muslims!

230
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,677
They stormed through the Eastern Gate.

231
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,874
Move away!

232
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:14,340
You have not protected the city,
and now you want to ruin us all.

233
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:18,121
A division of the Muslim Army has
entered through the Eastern Gate.

234
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:23,748
Unless we rush to their commander now
and sue for peace, we will all be ruined.

235
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:43,627
- The Muslims have conquered the city!
- They entered through the Eastern Gate!

236
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,415
Peace! Peace!

237
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,744
Peace, Sir!

238
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,126
We have opened the gates
for you willingly,

239
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,511
on the basis of the conditions
of security you have promised us.

240
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:05,373
We did this before your men who entered
through the Eastern Gate reached us.

241
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:40,205
Would you like to sit there, Sir?

242
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:22,140
The Covenant of Peace, Sir!

243
00:32:31,874 --> 00:32:35,113
Yes, we entered from our side by force,

244
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:38,140
but I faced little resistance
by the Bizantine guards.

245
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,344
Soon after that, a group of the residents
came to me peacefully.

246
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:46,157
They had expelled the Byzantine force
close to them,

247
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,031
and prevented them from fighting us.

248
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,705
In doing so, they exposed themselves
to retaliation by the Byzantines.

249
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,373
Prior to that, they helped us.

250
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:55,063
I gave them a pledge of safety
and security for themselves,

251
00:32:55,298 --> 00:32:59,064
their property, churches
and walls of the city,

252
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,254
a pledge by God and according to
the practice of God's messenger,

253
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:06,313
his successors and the believers. No one
approaches them with anything but good.

254
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:10,451
They have to pay the tribute, the jizyah,
and we will protect them against any enemy.

255
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:25,087
A commitment by any Muslim
is binding on the Muslim community.

256
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,856
Khalid is a leader.
We honour his pledge.

257
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,561
Tell me, people, am I dreaming?

258
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:59,010
Is this Damascus where we used
to come and do our trade?

259
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,043
We might hear some Byzantines
referring to us in their coversation.

260
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:06,337
We learnt from those of us who spoke their
language that they have contempt for us.

261
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:10,304
They described us as uncouth Bedouins.

262
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,836
They allow us into their city
only because they profit by our trade.

263
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:16,397
Here we are now: we are its kings.

264
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:21,183
Our Caliph is not a king, Abu Sufyan,
so that we become kings with him.

265
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,663
Call us what you will. The people
here are now under our rule.

266
00:34:27,993 --> 00:34:30,327
This is what was promised by God
and His Messenger.

267
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,556
True is their promise.

268
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:39,994
Would that Abu Sufyan came early to Islam.

269
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:43,806
He would have been a leader under
Islam as he was a leader before it.

270
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,694
But here is my son, Yazeed.

271
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:58,021
He achieved under Islam what I could
not achieve in Muslim leadership.

272
00:34:58,477 --> 00:35:03,115
I hope that my son, Mu'awiyah,
will attain what his father could not.

273
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:06,270
Will you settle here, Abu Sufyan?

274
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:09,794
In Damascus?

275
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:17,646
I am too old for that, Abu Yazeed.
I yearn for Makkah and Madinah.

276
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:20,492
What about you?

277
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,882
Maybe I will stay for a while.

278
00:35:24,475 --> 00:35:28,598
Jihad in Syria is not over yet.
Damascus is the crown jewel,

279
00:35:28,955 --> 00:35:33,580
but we shall not rest, nor let the enemy rest,
until we take Jerusalem, God willing.

280
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,508
Most warm welcome to you, Abu Yazeed.

281
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:50,269
You look as one in his prime,
despite your long journey.

282
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:52,408
Is this the effect of the air of Damascus?

283
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:56,270
Couldn't this great victory
have come ten years earlier?

284
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:02,944
All praise be to God, as I now see you
a fighter for God's cause.

285
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,298
He has shown you
how His promise comes true.

286
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:11,031
And I still have my front teeth
which Umar wanted to pull out,

287
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:12,860
so that I could not speak.

288
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:15,864
God's Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him),

289
00:36:16,158 --> 00:36:19,179
was without equal in magnanimity (generosity),
wisdom and knowledge.

290
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:25,519
You know that we hardly received
the happy news of the fall of Damascus

291
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,598
when I received a letter
from Al-Muthanna in Iraq

292
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,314
telling me that the Persians have appointed
a descendant of Khosrau as their king.

293
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:39,425
They compete in serving him.

294
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:44,955
Thus, the rivalry between them is over.

295
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:51,765
They have gathered their armies,
and sent advance forces to the rural areas,

296
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:56,297
coercing people to abandon their
agreements with our brothers (brethren).

297
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:01,814
Al-Muthanna and his army cannot
stand up to such a great force.

298
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:08,884
They want it a decisive battle,
which we also want.

299
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:16,751
I am instructing Abu Ubaidah to dispatch
Al-Qa'qa and Khalid's units to Iraq.

300
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,873
I have also written to Al-Muthanna,

301
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:25,227
instructing him to take his forces out
of the urban Persian areas

302
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,715
and move to the open places,

303
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:32,244
dividing his forces in the locations
close to the Persians.

304
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,060
They must recruit everyone in the Tribes
of Rabeeah and Mudar

305
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,851
and their allies,

306
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:47,712
either willingly or unwillingly.

307
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:52,695
They must get the Arabs to mobilize
their all as the Persians are doing.

308
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,320
Whatever calamity befalls the Arabs
will apply to all of them.

309
00:37:58,257 --> 00:38:04,400
Any bounty and blessing God grants
them will similarly apply to all.

310
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:11,712
Therefore, they must rise in total
when their enemy is all out against them.

311
00:38:12,027 --> 00:38:14,195
Yes. Yes.

312
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:17,757
I will be going out to meet them
when they have gathered.

313
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:21,334
Abu Al-Hassan will deputize
for me here in Madinah.

314
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:27,927
That you march at the head of the army
to Iraq is not a well advised plan.

315
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:31,743
Should you be killed or defeated
in such a decisive battle,

316
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:35,243
we fear that Muslims will not be able
to hold their own after that.

317
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:41,911
You better stay in Madinah, directing
armies and managing the state.

318
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:47,100
If victory is achieved,
this is what we all hope for.

319
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:52,411
Otherwise, you can send other troops
to engage the enemy

320
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:56,643
- until Allah grants us victory.
- Yes. Yes.

321
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:03,255
If this is is the accepted view, who shall
we appoint as army commander?

322
00:39:06,226 --> 00:39:08,650
The lion himself.

323
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:13,192
Saad Ibn Abi Waqqas.

324
00:39:34,349 --> 00:39:36,505
I do not want to lose all this!

325
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:43,222
I heard a wise man saying: 'A person
who owns much, fears for much.

326
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:45,505
The one who experiences
the happiness of kingship

327
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:48,243
will be the most distressed for losing it. '

328
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:50,938
The sense of loss is proportionate
to what is lost.

329
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:55,426
Today, I am the most worried,
that I may lose this one.

330
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,475
Are you referring to the Muslim army
which has encamped at Al-Qadisiyyah?

331
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,975
Rustom has not yet marched
with the army. Why the delay?

332
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:06,254
Every time I call him he says:

333
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:09,598
"Perhaps the state will be more stable
with me if I do not take part in the war,

334
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,940
and that patience is better than haste."

335
00:40:12,282 --> 00:40:16,875
It is better to engage only in skirmishes
until their omen becomes a a bad one.

336
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,877
He advised that Jalinous could march
at the head of an army to meet them.

337
00:40:21,142 --> 00:40:23,426
You should not call Rustom
or consult him.

338
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:25,626
You command him and he obeys.

339
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:28,906
I learnt that he consults the stars
and believes in them.

340
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:32,409
Let him and his stars perish
if the Muslims were to take Persia.

341
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:39,676
The stars write what we do.
It is not that we do what the stars write.

342
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:43,765
Those who read the stars only read
what is in their own minds.

343
00:40:44,098 --> 00:40:47,125
Show them that YOU,
not his stars, hold command.

344
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:53,031
A month! A whole month since the Arabs
encamped at Al-Qadisiyyah.

345
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:57,060
They have rested and recuperated.
They ate of the good food of the country,

346
00:40:57,065 --> 00:41:02,904
regained their strength, went all over Iraq
and brought it back under their control.

347
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:07,160
Every time I ordered you
to march to them...

348
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:09,434
at the head of an army the like
of which the Arabs have never seen,

349
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:13,531
you have excuses and delayed matters.
I don't know what goes on in your mind.

350
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,609
You may think: "He is a lad
who was one of the masses

351
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,748
and whose only hope was to survive.
We brought him here...

352
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:23,921
and placed him on his ancestors throne.
He does not know what kingship means."

353
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:28,824
No, I never sought this,
and I was content with what I had.

354
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:34,859
However, now that I am on the throne
of my ancestors,

355
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:41,887
I have the command and I will never
abandon my throne to my last breath.

356
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:47,731
We are all your servants, your majesty!

357
00:41:50,264 --> 00:41:54,093
If you fear to face the Arabs, then resign

358
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:58,340
and find for yourself some place far away
in Persia where you may tend sheep.

359
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:03,091
