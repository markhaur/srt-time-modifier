00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,460
Farouk Omar
(Omar Ibn Al-Khattab)

2
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,350
Episode 26.

3
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:21,934
You are very tired, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!

4
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:24,940
Wouldn't you rather go back
and have some sleep?

5
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:29,392
No. I will just rest here a little.

6
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:37,375
Daughter, get up
and add some water to the milk.

7
00:02:37,378 --> 00:02:40,580
In the morning you need
to go out and sell it.

8
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:42,350
God forbids, mother.

9
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,109
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen sent a crier making
clear that milk must not be mixed with water.

10
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,491
You cannot be seen here
by Umar or his crier.

11
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,552
Get up and do as I told you.

12
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:56,095
I would not obey him in public
and disobey him in private.

13
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,940
A small income with obedience to God
is better than plenty with a sin.

14
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:03,472
If Umar cannot see us,
God who never sleeps sees us.

15
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,062
Know the place, Aslam.

16
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:18,588
Tomorrow, find out who said what to who,
and whether they are married or not.

17
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:55,969
- Ameer Al-Mu'mineen!
- May we come in?

18
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,205
What is the matter, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?
I hope it is something good.

19
00:05:14,455 --> 00:05:17,175
Bring in your daughter please.

20
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:58,852
I went out on night watch last night,
then I felt tired.

21
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:01,592
I reclined against your wall

22
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:05,058
and God made me hear your conversation
concerning that milk you have.

23
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,138
I repent, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

24
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:11,042
God forgives sins and accepts repentance.

25
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:14,569
Indeed, but He is also stern in punishment.

26
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,088
So fear God and never do it again.

27
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:20,009
I will not. Certainly not.

28
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,632
As for you, how good you are.

29
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,006
I enquired about you and learnt that
the young woman is unmarried.

30
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:33,468
- Would you like to marry...
- Zainab. She is Zainab.

31
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:37,857
This is my son, Asim,
and he is unmarried.

32
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:41,859
I spoke to him about you
and encouraged him. He is willing.

33
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:47,138
Would you like to look at him
and let him look at you?

34
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:51,588
If you both like what you see,
we will marry you.

35
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:14,656
She must look at him first.

36
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,986
Do you accept him as husband?

37
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,732
Why wouldn't she accept
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen's son?

38
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:43,967
You are the guardian of both of them.
Silence is the sign of acceptance.

39
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:47,357
Do not be taken in by his being
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen's son.

40
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:49,155
He has no money of his own.

41
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:52,721
If he treats you badly,
I will give him double punishment.

42
00:07:54,002 --> 00:08:00,279
May God unite you two well
and give you good children.

43
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,566
You are not so shy and silnt in Istakhr
when I tried a bit of flirtation.

44
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,887
Had I known that you were
the Emperor, the king of kings.

45
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:48,221
I myself did not not know.
My mother had told me that

46
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:51,632
I am the grandson of the great emperor,
Khosrau Parvez,

47
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,552
and that she hid me so that my uncle
Shirweih could not lay his hands on me

48
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,068
and kill me as he killed his father, brothers

49
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,618
and all male descendents of his father.

50
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:05,615
She kept telling me not to let anyone
know this truth.

51
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,590
She told me that I must remain
an ordinary person.

52
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,865
Then you know what happened.

53
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:18,661
Now we are here in the white palace
which belonged to my forefathers.

54
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:23,172
How do you feel, your majesty, now
that you have regained your heritage?

55
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,133
I don't know.

56
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:30,931
I mean... sometimes I feel a stranger.

57
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:36,545
I have been used to ordinary life.
I look around me

58
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:41,304
and see princes, commanders, nobility
and servants prostrating themselves to me.

59
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:44,495
I have the treasures of my forefathers.

60
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:48,700
I only have to give a signal
for someone to be killed,

61
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:53,922
or to fall from luxury to misery,
or to rise from misery to luxury.

62
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,812
This makes me feel that
I am bigger than life, greater than death,

63
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:02,734
and that a light of the Great Spirit
is now inside me.

64
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:05,767
It is what brought me to the throne
of my forefathers

65
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:09,466
and to the White Palace.
Why wouldn't all this please me?

66
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:17,917
I do know now why princes have fought
each other for the throne, killing one another.

67
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,704
Enter please.

68
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:30,704
Peace be to you, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
- And to you two be peace.

69
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,623
Sit down, both of you.

70
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:37,566
My Lord, help me against them both.

71
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:40,703
Each one of them wants me
to slip in his favor.

72
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:46,345
Fear God concerning your dispute.

73
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:50,120
We only judge in accordance with
what appears to us to be right.

74
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:52,292
We have no knowledge
of what is in people's hearts.

75
00:10:53,657 --> 00:11:00,276
Remember what the Prophet said:
"You come to me with your disputes.

76
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:09,541
Some of you may have a better argument,
and I may judge for him according to what I hear.

77
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,360
If I give a person something
that rightfully belongs to his brother,

78
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:18,206
he should not take it.
I am only giving him a brand of fire."

79
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:23,669
Present your complaint, Dahhak,
before your opponent.

80
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,450
I have at Al-Urayyid a spring of water.

81
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:31,279
In between the spring and my farm

82
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:34,110
lies a plot of land belonging
to Muhammad Ibn Maslamah.

83
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:40,340
If I want to run the water to my land,
it must go through Muhammad's land,

84
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,289
but he denied me that.

85
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:48,315
I said to him, "It is a benefit for you:
You can have your drinking water

86
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:52,659
and irrigate your land if you wish.
It will not be of any disadvantage to you."

87
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,584
But he still refuses.

88
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,469
Why do you deny your brother
something that benefits him

89
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:01,423
when it is of benefit to you too?
You can use it without any disadvantage.

90
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:05,807
It is my land, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen,

91
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:10,377
I am free to do whatever I like with it,
permitting anything or refusing it.

92
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:15,283
I fear that if I let this go that he
and his family take advantage of that,

93
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:21,409
enter it and spoil my things there.
It is as if I leave it to any passerby.

94
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:32,502
That it is your property is acknowledged.

95
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:36,458
However, your refusal harms him.

96
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:39,879
It is as if you are preventing him
to benefit by his land.

97
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,669
This does not brings you any benefit,

98
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:46,444
while letting the water through
will benefit both of you,

99
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:50,488
without giving you any disadvantage.
Do you give priority to harm over benefit?

100
00:12:51,585 --> 00:12:55,739
We are only in charge
of what God has given us.

101
00:12:56,365 --> 00:13:00,934
We should use it for benefit
to ourselves and others.

102
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,879
The purpose is to build the earth.

103
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:11,051
You may stipulate that he must not harm
your land. If he does, I will punish him.

104
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:15,521
Won't you let me have a choice in my
own land, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

105
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,443
There is no choice in this matter.

106
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,679
He shall have his water running
despite your objections. This is final.

107
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:25,754
- Peace be to you.
- And to you be peace.

108
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:31,001
Enter!

109
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,380
- Is is a complaint?
- Yes, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

110
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,224
- Against Hatib Ibn Abi Balta'ah?
- Against these servants of his.

111
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,036
They work for me, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

112
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,628
- What have they done?
- They stole my she-camel.

113
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,199
- Did you?
- We did, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

114
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:55,357
Then we will implement the punishment
for theft against you.

115
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,900
Tell me first, what have you done
with his she-camel?

116
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:07,053
We slaughtered it,
ate of it and fed other people.

117
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,037
Why did you do that?

118
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,865
Speak out. Do not worry about him.

119
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:19,712
Because of hunger, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
It has bitten hard at us.

120
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:23,920
Don't you give your servants
enough to eat, Hatib?

121
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:32,538
All power operates by God's will.
Where has compassion gone?

122
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:36,607
You employ them and leave them hungry?

123
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:40,892
Even if any of them eats what God
has forbidden, he will incur no sin,

124
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:45,365
as God says: "He who is driven by
necessity, not intending to transgress

125
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:50,956
nor exceeding his need, incurs no sin.
God is Much-Forgiving, Merciful."
(Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 173)

126
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,662
I am sparing them the mandatory
punishment because of suspected necessity.

127
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:57,434
In case of doubt, it is better
to suspend mandatory punishments

128
00:14:57,713 --> 00:15:01,225
than to implement them.
All three of you leave now.

129
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,318
What about my she-camel,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen?

130
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,628
By God, as I have spared
them the punishment,

131
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:12,338
I shall fine you heavily. You are
the one who caused this offence.

132
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,867
How much were you offered
for your she-camel?

133
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:19,227
- Four hundred dirhams.
- Go and give him eight hundred.

134
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:21,910
- Am I to give him double its price?
- Yes, you will.

135
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:26,230
I shall be enquiring about your servants.
If I hear that you have kept them hungry,

136
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:29,921
causing them to incur a mandatory
punishment, you will suffer that punishment.

137
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,707
The case is settled.

138
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:51,795
- Peace be to Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.
- And to you be peace with God's mercy.

139
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:54,448
- I am seeking your advice.
- Speak!

140
00:15:56,544 --> 00:16:04,204
I have a daughter. In pre-Islamic days
I took her out aiming to bury her alive.

141
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:11,577
When I put her under the dust,
I was overwhelmed with compassion

142
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:16,815
and I took her out.
Then we embraced Islam.

143
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:24,909
When she was a young woman,
she incurred a grave sin.

144
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,781
You mean adultery?

145
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:38,933
She took a blade to commit suicide.

146
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:43,188
We saved her after she had cut
some of her veins.

147
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:46,921
I had treated her
until she regained her health.

148
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:53,656
Subsequently she truly repented
and she is of good character.

149
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:58,522
She is thus one of those whose bad
actions God changes into good ones.

150
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:05,861
Now someone wants to marry her.
Should I inform him of what happened?

151
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:09,720
Would you expose something
God wants to remain hidden?

152
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,452
If you tell anyone of what she did,

153
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,904
I will make of you an example
to all people in all provinces.

154
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,312
Give her in marriage
as a chaste Muslim woman.

155
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:29,310
You have removed my burden,
Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

156
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:34,120
May God remove all worry from you
in this life and in the hereafter.

157
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,884
Do not do that.
It will be a negative point for you,

158
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,993
and an act of pride on my part,
which God dislikes.

159
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,565
I am only one of the Muslim community,

160
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,967
but my test is harder than yours
because of my position.

161
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,724
Go to your business, may God bless you.

162
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:41,591
My Lord, I have tried my best
to arrive at the right rulings

163
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,013
on questions to which nothing
in the Qur'an or the Sunnah

164
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,005
of the Prophet appeared applicable.

165
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,761
My aim is to set things to right, as far
as far as I can.

166
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:59,310
This is my understanding of Your Faith.
If I am right,

167
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:02,001
It is because of Your guidance,

168
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:06,611
and if I am wrong, it is because
of my own faulty understanding.

169
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,531
In You I place my trust, and to You I turn.

170
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:26,639
Abu Al-Hasan, I have been having
too many cases of complaints to look into.

171
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,975
I would love that you will
share these with me,

172
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:34,906
so that you judge in disputes as I do.

173
00:19:35,157 --> 00:19:38,833
You are the depository of knowledge
of Islam and a guide to the Truth.

174
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:43,812
Suppose that I give a ruling
on a certain case,

175
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,582
and you hear of my ruling
but disagree with it. What will you do?

176
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:55,141
Where there is a clear statement
in God's Book or the Prophet's sunnah,

177
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,733
we can have no dispute.

178
00:19:57,144 --> 00:20:00,034
You know them better than anyone else.

179
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:03,784
On cases left to personal discretion,
we are equal.

180
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,407
Everyone judges as he sees right.

181
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:10,053
I will not abrogate a ruling given by Abu
Al-Hassan on the basis of his discretion,

182
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:14,297
even though I may have a different view.
We pray for God's guidance.

183
00:20:15,017 --> 00:20:18,379
Then I will do, Ameer Al-Mu'mineen.

184
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:24,019
May God always keep me
where Abu Al-Hasan is.

185
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,197
We are witnessing events

186
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,649
with no parallel that happened
during the Prophet's lifetime.

187
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:40,527
We do not find in God's Book
rulings applicable to them.

188
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,612
We judge them as we see fit,

189
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,785
according to our understanding
of the objectives of our religion

190
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,506
and the interests of the people.

191
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:53,432
Personal judgement
by the Prophet was right,

192
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:58,224
because God showed him,
but revelation has ceased.

193
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,063
When we judge on the basis
of personal discretion,

194
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:08,818
no one may say that his own judgement
is God's judgement.

195
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:11,794
Anyone who says so claims to be
privy to God's own knowledge

196
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,047
and purposes while others are not.

197
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:18,646
If you disagree with him you will be as
if you disagree with God.

198
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:22,331
Soon enough,
he will brand you as disbeliever.

199
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,613
He may even consider
that you deserve to be killed.

200
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,861
That is certainly a disastrous
state of affairs.

201
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:33,805
Discretion is available to all.

202
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:38,088
People may have different views
on the same question.

203
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:40,893
Besides, one may have
a certain view today,

204
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:47,136
but then discovers that a different view
is better, so he abandons his first one.

205
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:52,273
I ruled on a particular question
according to my discretion,

206
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:57,628
and then I heard someone saying:
'This is God's ruling and Umar's ruling'.

207
00:21:57,837 --> 00:22:01,618
I was about to punish him severely.
It was a bad utterance.

208
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:10,109
That was Umar's judgement. If it
is right, then that is by God's grace,

209
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:15,070
and if it is wrong,
then it is Umar's mistake.

210
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:25,253
O people! O people!
Follow the Sunnah!

211
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:29,456
Follow the course which is defined
by God and His Messenger.

212
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:32,395
What is determined on the basis of personal
Discretion must not be considered...

213
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,628
in the same status.

214
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:50,755
- Peace be to you with God's mercy.
- And to you be peace with God's mercy.

215
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,926
You must be meeting for something
special. Let us hope it is good.

216
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:58,628
I received news that the Bishop
of the city had a son

217
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:04,152
and he is hosting a celebration tonight,
giving people much to eat and drink.

218
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,601
And are we to celebrate with him?

219
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,520
Yes, in our own way.

220
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:14,186
I also learnt that he will send much food
and drink to the city guards.

221
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:19,115
When these drink, they are excessive
and they get drunk or nearly so.

222
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,194
This gives us an opportunity
we must not miss.

223
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,900
- You mean...
- Yes, it seems it is time.

224
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,302
Deep into the night,
they will be much less alert,

225
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,742
due to their drunkenness and sleepiness.
We can climb the wall then.

226
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:37,023
At the Eastern Gate?
But it is the most difficult.

227
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:40,381
Yes, but it is the least guarded,
as our scouts have confirmed.

228
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:43,948
They rely on the strength of the gate
and the thickness of the wall next to it.

229
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,294
The Muslims! The Muslims!

230
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,677
They stormed through the Eastern Gate.

231
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,874
Move away!

232
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:20,340
You have not protected the city,
and now you want to ruin us all.

233
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:24,121
A division of the Muslim Army has
entered through the Eastern Gate.

234
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:29,748
Unless we rush to their commander now
and sue for peace, we will all be ruined.

235
00:28:44,327 --> 00:28:49,627
- The Muslims have conquered the city!
- They entered through the Eastern Gate!

236
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,415
Peace! Peace!

237
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,744
Peace, Sir!

238
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,126
We have opened the gates
for you willingly,

239
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:05,511
on the basis of the conditions
of security you have promised us.

240
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:11,373
We did this before your men who entered
through the Eastern Gate reached us.

241
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:46,205
Would you like to sit there, Sir?

242
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,140
The Covenant of Peace, Sir!

243
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,113
Yes, we entered from our side by force,

244
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:44,140
but I faced little resistance
by the Bizantine guards.

245
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,344
Soon after that, a group of the residents
came to me peacefully.

246
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:52,157
They had expelled the Byzantine force
close to them,

247
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:54,031
and prevented them from fighting us.

248
00:32:54,314 --> 00:32:56,705
In doing so, they exposed themselves
to retaliation by the Byzantines.

249
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,373
Prior to that, they helped us.

250
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,063
I gave them a pledge of safety
and security for themselves,

251
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:05,064
their property, churches
and walls of the city,

252
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,254
a pledge by God and according to
the practice of God's messenger,

253
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,313
his successors and the believers. No one
approaches them with anything but good.

254
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:16,451
They have to pay the tribute, the jizyah,
and we will protect them against any enemy.

255
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:31,087
A commitment by any Muslim
is binding on the Muslim community.

256
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,856
Khalid is a leader.
We honour his pledge.

257
00:33:58,063 --> 00:34:00,561
Tell me, people, am I dreaming?

258
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:05,010
Is this Damascus where we used
to come and do our trade?

259
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:08,043
We might hear some Byzantines
referring to us in their coversation.

260
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:12,337
We learnt from those of us who spoke their
language that they have contempt for us.

261
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:16,304
They described us as uncouth Bedouins.

262
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,836
They allow us into their city
only because they profit by our trade.

263
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,397
Here we are now: we are its kings.

264
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:27,183
Our Caliph is not a king, Abu Sufyan,
so that we become kings with him.

265
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,663
Call us what you will. The people
here are now under our rule.

266
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:36,327
This is what was promised by God
and His Messenger.

267
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,556
True is their promise.

268
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,994
Would that Abu Sufyan came early to Islam.

269
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,806
He would have been a leader under
Islam as he was a leader before it.

270
00:34:57,522 --> 00:34:59,694
But here is my son, Yazeed.

271
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:04,021
He achieved under Islam what I could
not achieve in Muslim leadership.

272
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:09,115
I hope that my son, Mu'awiyah,
will attain what his father could not.

273
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:12,270
Will you settle here, Abu Sufyan?

274
00:35:14,226 --> 00:35:15,794
In Damascus?

275
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:23,646
I am too old for that, Abu Yazeed.
I yearn for Makkah and Madinah.

276
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,492
What about you?

277
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:29,882
Maybe I will stay for a while.

278
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:34,598
Jihad in Syria is not over yet.
Damascus is the crown jewel,

279
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:39,580
but we shall not rest, nor let the enemy rest,
until we take Jerusalem, God willing.

280
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,508
Most warm welcome to you, Abu Yazeed.

281
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:56,269
You look as one in his prime,
despite your long journey.

282
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:58,408
Is this the effect of the air of Damascus?

283
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:02,270
Couldn't this great victory
have come ten years earlier?

284
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:08,944
All praise be to God, as I now see you
a fighter for God's cause.

285
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:12,298
He has shown you
how His promise comes true.

286
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:17,031
And I still have my front teeth
which Umar wanted to pull out,

287
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:18,860
so that I could not speak.

288
00:36:19,192 --> 00:36:21,864
God's Messenger (Peace Be Upon Him),

289
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:25,179
was without equal in magnanimity (generosity),
wisdom and knowledge.

290
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:31,519
You know that we hardly received
the happy news of the fall of Damascus

291
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:35,598
when I received a letter
from Al-Muthanna in Iraq

292
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,314
telling me that the Persians have appointed
a descendant of Khosrau as their king.

293
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:45,425
They compete in serving him.

294
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:50,955
Thus, the rivalry between them is over.

295
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:57,765
They have gathered their armies,
and sent advance forces to the rural areas,

296
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:02,297
coercing people to abandon their
agreements with our brothers (brethren).

297
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:07,814
Al-Muthanna and his army cannot
stand up to such a great force.

298
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:14,884
They want it a decisive battle,
which we also want.

299
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:22,751
I am instructing Abu Ubaidah to dispatch
Al-Qa'qa and Khalid's units to Iraq.

300
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,873
I have also written to Al-Muthanna,

301
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,227
instructing him to take his forces out
of the urban Persian areas

302
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,715
and move to the open places,

303
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:38,244
dividing his forces in the locations
close to the Persians.

304
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,060
They must recruit everyone in the Tribes
of Rabeeah and Mudar

305
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,851
and their allies,

306
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:53,712
either willingly or unwillingly.

307
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:58,695
They must get the Arabs to mobilize
their all as the Persians are doing.

308
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,320
Whatever calamity befalls the Arabs
will apply to all of them.

309
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:10,400
Any bounty and blessing God grants
them will similarly apply to all.

310
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:17,712
Therefore, they must rise in total
when their enemy is all out against them.

311
00:38:18,027 --> 00:38:20,195
Yes. Yes.

312
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:23,757
I will be going out to meet them
when they have gathered.

313
00:38:24,866 --> 00:38:27,334
Abu Al-Hassan will deputize
for me here in Madinah.

314
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:33,927
That you march at the head of the army
to Iraq is not a well advised plan.

315
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,743
Should you be killed or defeated
in such a decisive battle,

316
00:38:37,993 --> 00:38:41,243
we fear that Muslims will not be able
to hold their own after that.

317
00:38:41,523 --> 00:38:47,911
You better stay in Madinah, directing
armies and managing the state.

318
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:53,100
If victory is achieved,
this is what we all hope for.

319
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:58,411
Otherwise, you can send other troops
to engage the enemy

320
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:02,643
- until Allah grants us victory.
- Yes. Yes.

321
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:09,255
If this is is the accepted view, who shall
we appoint as army commander?

322
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,650
The lion himself.

323
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,192
Saad Ibn Abi Waqqas.

324
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,505
I do not want to lose all this!

325
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:49,222
I heard a wise man saying: 'A person
who owns much, fears for much.

326
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:51,505
The one who experiences
the happiness of kingship

327
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:54,243
will be the most distressed for losing it. '

328
00:39:54,549 --> 00:39:56,938
The sense of loss is proportionate
to what is lost.

329
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:01,426
Today, I am the most worried,
that I may lose this one.

330
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:05,475
Are you referring to the Muslim army
which has encamped at Al-Qadisiyyah?

331
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,975
Rustom has not yet marched
with the army. Why the delay?

332
00:40:10,143 --> 00:40:12,254
Every time I call him he says:

333
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,598
"Perhaps the state will be more stable
with me if I do not take part in the war,

334
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:17,940
and that patience is better than haste."

335
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,875
It is better to engage only in skirmishes
until their omen becomes a a bad one.

336
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,877
He advised that Jalinous could march
at the head of an army to meet them.

337
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:29,426
You should not call Rustom
or consult him.

338
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,626
You command him and he obeys.

339
00:40:31,844 --> 00:40:34,906
I learnt that he consults the stars
and believes in them.

340
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:38,409
Let him and his stars perish
if the Muslims were to take Persia.

341
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:45,676
The stars write what we do.
It is not that we do what the stars write.

342
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:49,765
Those who read the stars only read
what is in their own minds.

343
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:53,125
Show them that YOU,
not his stars, hold command.

344
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:59,031
A month! A whole month since the Arabs
encamped at Al-Qadisiyyah.

345
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:03,060
They have rested and recuperated.
They ate of the good food of the country,

346
00:41:03,065 --> 00:41:08,904
regained their strength, went all over Iraq
and brought it back under their control.

347
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:13,160
Every time I ordered you
to march to them...

348
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,434
at the head of an army the like
of which the Arabs have never seen,

349
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:19,531
you have excuses and delayed matters.
I don't know what goes on in your mind.

350
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:23,609
You may think: "He is a lad
who was one of the masses

351
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:25,748
and whose only hope was to survive.
We brought him here...

352
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,921
and placed him on his ancestors throne.
He does not know what kingship means."

353
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:34,824
No, I never sought this,
and I was content with what I had.

354
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:40,859
However, now that I am on the throne
of my ancestors,

355
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:47,887
I have the command and I will never
abandon my throne to my last breath.

356
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:53,731
We are all your servants, your majesty!

357
00:41:56,264 --> 00:42:00,093
If you fear to face the Arabs, then resign

358
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:04,340
and find for yourself some place far away
in Persia where you may tend sheep.

359
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:09,091
